Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a game
   show-based curriculum improves obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN)
   residents' confidence in and understanding of the principles of
   reproductive infectious disease (RID), clinical manifestations and
   sequelae of sexually transmitted infection (STI), and management of
   serious long-term consequences of STIs.
   Methods: A game show-based curriculum was developed from the basic
   principles of RID, which include the following: (1) distinguishing
   between clinical manifestations of STIs and management of long-term
   sequelae of STIs; (2) evaluation and management of common gynecologic
   infectious diseases, including chronic vaginitis, pelvic inflammatory
   disease, and other pelvic infections; (3) diagnosis and management of
   perinatal infectious diseases, such as parvovirus, varicella-zoster
   virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, toxoplasmosis, and
   infection-mediated prematurity; (4) evaluation and management of
   obstetric and gynecologic postoperative infections; and (5) diagnosis
   and management of acute and chronic human immunodeficiency virus and
   hepatitis C virus infections in pregnancy. OBGYN residents at a large
   urban academic training program were randomized to either a
   Jeopardy-style educational game show intervention plus a traditional
   didactic-based curriculum or traditional didactic-based curriculum
   alone. The study team recruited participants by sending out an e-mail to
   all of the residents, detailing the study and consent process.
   Participants from both the intervention and control groups completed
   confidence and knowledge-based pretests. Posttests were administered 4
   weeks after completion of the pretests. Statistical methods were applied
   to analyze the data.
   Results: Thirty-eight residents were randomized to a Jeopardy-style game
   show-based educational intervention (n = 19) or to a traditional
   didactic-based curriculum (n = 19). All of the participants (100\%)
   completed the pre- and posttests. Pretest median scores were similar
   between both groups, in which the Jeopardy group had a median score of
   48.5 and the traditional group had a median score of 51.4 (P = 0.091).
   The Jeopardy group median test scores improved between the pretest and
   posttest (48.5 vs 62.8, P <= 0.001). The traditional didactic-based
   curriculum had a minimal increase in its median posttest scores (51.4
   compared with 54.2, P = 0.773). The Jeopardy group had significantly
   higher posttest median scores and confidence scores than the traditional
   didactic-based curriculum (Jeopardy = 62.8, traditional = 54.2, P =
   0.002).
   Conclusions: A game show-based curriculum improves OBGYN residents'
   confidence and retention of knowledge regarding RIDs, clinical
   manifestations and sequelae of STIs, and management of serious long-term
   consequences of STIs. Additional studies that include longer posttest
   time intervals are needed to assess the longer-term impact of game
   show-based curriculum on knowledge retention among OBGYN residents.}},

Abstract = {{Music education taught at music schools should aim to have a positive
   impact on the social well-being of the imbricated communities. The
   design and development of socio-educational and community projects in
   music training centres are tasks which, in using music as a tool towards
   mediation, can contribute to alleviate social dysfunctions in the nearby
   surroundings as well as to create social cohesion and feelings of
   community belonging and identity. Nevertheless, there is some inertia in
   the way things are done and a perpetuation of traditional models of
   education in music where there is no room for innovative projects with
   authentic social engagement. This paper will analyse the challenges and
   contexts that music schools face in the 21st Century at a social and
   community level, and how to address them with new educational models.
   The social commitment and engagement of music training institutions
   should spark a change in the design of activities through innovation as
   well as opening new avenues for collaboration with other social and
   institutional community actors. To illustrate these synergies as well as
   the design process of a socio-educational project, a proposal design of
   a socio-educational workshop will be put forth as a practical guide in
   the development of these programmes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Considering the high prevalence of anxiety among adolescents
   and its horrible consequences, appropriate educational methods have to
   be used to prevent, control, and treat anxiety.
   Aim: To compare the effects of anxiety management training via
   microlearning and gamification on anxiety control among girl
   adolescents.
   Methods: In this randomized clinical trial with pre/posttest design, the
   research population included 13-15-year-old girl adolescents studying in
   the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades of high school in Shiraz in the
   academic year 2018-2019. The participants (n=378) were randomly selected
   from the schools and assigned to microlearning (n=125), gamification
   (n=129), and control (n=124) groups. After conducting the pretest using
   Spielberger's state/trait anxiety inventory, the educational
   intervention was carried out via microlearning and gamification for four
   weeks. The adolescents' anxiety levels were measured again immediately
   and two weeks after the intervention.
   Results: The results revealed no significant difference among the three
   groups regarding the mean scores of state anxiety (p=0.07) and trait
   anxiety (p=0.26) before the intervention. However, a significant
   difference was observed among the three groups concerning anxiety scores
   immediately and two weeks after the intervention (p<0.001). This
   indicated the effectiveness of microlearning and gamification in
   reducing anxiety. Nonetheless, the two intervention methods were not
   significantly different in decreasing the level of anxiety (p>0.05).
   Conclusion: The results demonstrated a decline in the microlearning and
   gamification groups' scores of state and trait anxiety after the
   intervention. Yet, anxiety reduced to a similar level in both
   intervention groups. Hence, the two methods were similarly effective in
   controlling the adolescents' anxiety. Therefore, both microlearning and
   gamification could be used to promote adolescents' mental health.}},

Abstract = {{Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that has been reported in Malaysia
   and has been associated with a recent trend of recreational activities
   among the youth. Thus, efforts such as educational interventions among
   high-risk populations, especially the youth, are key to increasing
   public awareness regarding leptospirosis. This paper presents the
   findings of a pilot study wherein an educational intervention using a
   gamification intervention method was used to determine changes in
   leptospirosis knowledge among youth. On this note, students from a
   public university in Seremban district, Malaysia, were recruited and
   were asked to complete questionnaires before and after gamification
   activities. Baseline and immediate post-intervention data on
   leptospirosis knowledge were obtained. The total knowledge score was
   calculated, and differences in the mean pre- and post-intervention
   knowledge score were determined. Of the total 185 questionnaires that
   were completed at baseline and immediately post-intervention, only 168
   that belonged to respondents who had heard of leptospirosis were
   analysed in this paper. A significant increase in leptospirosis
   knowledge was observed for the students following health education by
   gamification (p < 0.01). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of an
   educational intervention using gamification in improving leptospirosis
   knowledge among youth and suggest that gamification could become an
   efficient tool to prevent the disease within university-age

Abstract = {{BackgroundPersonal convictions in referral to pain cause misbeliefs in
   health professionals, which can influence patients who suffer from
   non-specific chronic low back pain. Likewise, health professionals'
   beliefs affect their advice and attitudes towards patients' treatment,

Title = {{Finding the `QR' to Patient Safety: Applying Gamification to Incorporate
   Patient Safety Priorities Through a Simulated `Escape Room' Experience}},
Journal = {{CUREUS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 5}},
Abstract = {{Medical errors are the eighth leading cause of mortality in the United
   States and contribute to over one million preventable injuries. In an
   effort to prevent medical errors, reporting systems serve as invaluable
   tools to detect patient safety events and quality problems
   longitudinally. Historically, trainees (i.e., students and residents)
   rarely submit incident reports for encountered patient safety threats.
   The authors propose an immersive learning experience utilizing
   gamification theory and leveraging the increasingly popular `escape
   room' to help resident trainees identify reportable patient safety
   priorities.
   All 130 incoming intern physicians at the Thomas Jefferson University
   (Jefferson) were enrolled in the Patient Safety Escape Room study as
   part of their residency orientation (June 2018). The residents were
   randomly divided into 16 teams. Each team was immersed in a simulated
   escape room, tasked with identifying a predetermined set of serious
   patient safety hazards, and successfully manually entering them into the
   Jefferson Event Reporting System within the time allotted to
   successfully `win the game' by `escaping the room'. Quick response (QR)
   codes were planted throughout the activity to provide in-game
   instructions; clues to solve the puzzle; and key information about
   patient safety priorities at Jefferson. All participants underwent a
   formal debriefing using the feedback capture grid method and completed a
   voluntary post-study survey, adapted from Brookfield's Critical Incident
   Questionnaire (CIQ). The study was IRB exempt.
   Thematic analysis of the post-activity CIQ survey (n = 102) revealed
   that interns were engaged during the immersive learning experience (n =
   42) and were specifically engaged by having to independently identify
   patient safety threats (n = 30). Participants identified team role
   assignment (n = 52) and effective communication (n = 26) as the two most
   helpful actions needed to successfully complete the activity.
   Participants were overall surprised by the success of the education
   innovation (n = 45) and reported that it changed how they viewed patient
   safety threats. Areas for improvement include clearer game instructions
   and using a more streamlined event reporting process.
   The escape room patient-safety activity allowed interns to actively
   engage in an innovative orientation activity that highlighted the
   importance of patient safety hazards, as well as providing them with the
   opportunity to document event reports in real-time. Next steps will
   include longitudinally tracking the quantity of error reports entered by
   this cohort to determine the effectiveness of this educational
   intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Gamification in higher education has been shown to provide a diverse
   range of learning opportunities for higher education practitioners as

   to aid pharmacology learning for medical students, we now test the
   reproducibility of our novel finding that this game leads to appreciable
   and sustained learning gains in medical students from two different
   higher education institutes. Here we present student feedback, thematic
   analysis and quantitative pre-and post-test data collected from students
   who played Braincept (TM). Our data shows that this style of gamified

Title = {{Gamification of Hospital Utilization: Incorporating Cost-consciousness
   in Daily Practices}},
Journal = {{CUREUS}},

Abstract = {{Healthcare costs in the United States have skyrocketed over the past
   decade, contributing to an estimated \$750 billion in wasteful spending
   annually. Despite the demand to improve residency education on
   value-based, cost-conscious healthcare, there is no consensus on how to
   best teach this practice. Traditional lectures have failed to
   demonstrate enduring change in clinical practice patterns, provider
   attitudes, and reductions in hospital expenditures. We sought to
   evaluate whether gamification is an effective pedagogical tool to teach
   cost-consciousness to emergency medicine (EM) residents by creating a
   60-minute interactive session based on the popular gameshow, the Price
   is Right. Costs and associated charges for common laboratory tests,
   radiographic studies, medications, and common physical resources
   typically found in the emergency department (ED) were first obtained
   through direct communication with the ED clinical director and hospital
   leadership. The session itself consisted of three phases with several
   Price-is-Right-themed games, which included realistic visual stimuli
   reminiscent of the gameshow that were created by the authors using the
   PowerPoint. Formal quantitative and qualitative feedback was solicited
   at the end of the session. Quantitative evaluation of the educational
   intervention was obtained through a 22-item questionnaire using a
   five-point Likert-type scale from 19 of the 22 enrolled residents (86\%
   response rate). Responses were generally very positive with an overall
   course rating score of 4.16 (SD +/- 0.90). Qualitative feedback
   identified learners' predilection for gamified delivery of nonclinical
   content during conference. The majority of residents (89\%) recommend
   the activity to be used in subsequent offerings to other learners. With
   healthcare costs on the rise, our feasibility study demonstrated that
   gamification is an effective way to teach mindful, cost-conscious care
   to EM residents. Gamification offers a fun and engaging alternative that
   should be further utilized in EM educational formats. Future studies are
   needed to longitudinally assess the learner retention and
   cost-containment practices.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Health education is one of the primary tools for health
   promotion, especially for those that will be responsible for educating
   on healthy habits in the future.
   Objective: To improve healthy lifestyle habits in university students
   through an educational intervention based on gamification.
   Method: A cuasiexperimental design of two groups (i.e., experimental
   groups and control group) with pretest and postest measurements was
   carried out. A 4-month intervention was implemented in 148 students from
   the Physical Activity and Sport Sciences university degree. Habits
   related to diet and physical activity were evaluated using a
   questionnaire (scaled from -40 a +50) and the teaching-learning process
   through a qualitative analysis.
   Results: At the end of the intervention, a very signifi cant improvement
   was found in the global value of the healthy lifestyle habits of the
   experimental group (+13,5), highlighting the improvement obtained in its
   higher level of compliance in the breakfast (53,4\%), in the number of
   diary meals (31,5\%), in the reduction of the consumption of soft-drinks
   (19,2\%) and in the increase of physical activity level, with an
   improvement of 12,3\% of participants with respect to the baseline
   levels. On the other hand, no signifi cant improvements were found in
   the control group.
   Conclusions: An educational intervention based on gamification improves
   healthy lifestyle habits of the students.}},

Abstract = {{E-learning systems and environments have progressively infiltrated all
   grades of Education, either in a complementary role to face-to-face
   instruction in class under blended learning scenarios or in purely
   remote education. The relative merits of face-to-face instruction versus
   e-learning, especially in Primary Education, are still an open research
   issue, though. Another challenge that Primary Education faces is the
   development of STEM thinking and STEM-friendly attitudes in pupils of
   early ages. An educational intervention that attempts to address both
   issues is designed, implemented and evaluated in this paper. Motivation
   and engagement of young pupils are sought through the gamification of
   the learning process. The present study investigates the feasibility and
   the efficiency of an asynchronous e-learning scenario involving an
   on-line game, for pupils of 10-11 years, in the 5th grade of Primary
   School. A basic STEM subject, Computer Programming Principles, is
   selected as the learning material to be taught purely remotely, through
   the e-learning environment designed and developed in moodle, for the
   purposes of this research. The educational intervention provides data on
   the learning outcomes of the pupils and on the efficiency of the
   approach. Evaluation results verify both the feasibility and the
   efficiency of this approach. Pupils and parents emphasize the role of
   the teacher who provides support and guidance through the platform
   communication tools; their attitudes are seen to change in favor of
   e-learning.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Health education and behavior change programs targeting
   specific risk factors have demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing
   the development of future diseases. Alzheimer disease (AD) shares many
   of the same risk factors, most of which can be addressed via behavior
   change. It is therefore theorized that a behavior change intervention
   targeting these risk factors would likely result in favorable rates of
   AD prevention.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to reduce the future risk of
   developing AD, while in the short term promoting vascular health,
   through behavior change.
   Methods: The study was an interventional randomized controlled trial
   consisting of subjects who were randomly assigned into either treatment
   (n=102) or control group (n=42). Outcome measures included various
   blood-based biomarkers, anthropometric measures, and behaviors related
   to AD risk. The treatment group was provided with a bespoke ``Gray
   Matters{''} mobile phone app designed to encourage and facilitate
   behavior change. The app presented evidence-based educational material
   relating to AD risk and prevention strategies, facilitated
   self-reporting of behaviors across 6 behavioral domains, and presented
   feedback on the user's performance, calculated from reported behaviors
   against recommended guidelines.
   Results: This paper explores the rationale for a mobile phone-led
   intervention and details the app's effect on behavior change and
   subsequent clinical outcomes. Via the app, the average participant
   submitted 7.3 (SD 3.2) behavioral logs/day (n=122,719). Analysis of
   these logs against primary outcome measures revealed that participants
   who improved their high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels during
   the study duration answered a statistically significant higher number of
   questions per day (mean 8.30, SD 2.29) than those with no improvement
   (mean 6.52, SD 3.612), t(97.74)=-3.051, P=.003. Participants who
   decreased their body mass index (BMI) performed significantly better in
   attaining their recommended daily goals (mean 56.21 SD 30.4\%) than
   those who increased their BMI (mean 40.12 SD 29.1\%), t(80)=-2.449,
   P=.017. In total, 69.2\% (n=18) of those who achieved a mean performance
   percentage of 60\% or higher, across all domains, reduced their BMI
   during the study, whereas 60.7\% (n=34) who did not, increased their
   BMI. One-way analysis of variance of systolic blood pressure category
   changes showed a significant correlation between reported efforts to
   reduce stress and category change as a whole, P=.035. An exit survey
   highlighted that respondents (n=83) reported that the app motivated them
   to perform physical activity (85.4\%) and make healthier food choices
   (87.5\%).
   Conclusions: In this study, the ubiquitous nature of the mobile phone
   excelled as a delivery platform for the intervention, enabling the
   dissemination of educational intervention material while simultaneously
   monitoring and encouraging positive behavior change, resulting in
   desirable clinical effects. Sustained effort to maintain the achieved
   behaviors is expected to mitigate future AD risk.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction The last decade has seen many changes in graduate medical
   education training in the USA, most notably the implementation of duty
   hour standards for residents by the Accreditation Council of Graduate
   Medical Education. As educators are left to balance more limited time
   available between patient care and resident education, new methods to
   augment traditional graduate medical education are needed.
   Objectives To assess acceptance and use of a novel gamification-based
   medical knowledge software among internal medicine residents and to
   determine retention of information presented to participants by this
   medical knowledge software.
   Methods We designed and developed software using principles of
   gamification to deliver a web-based medical knowledge competition among
   internal medicine residents at the University of Alabama (UA) at
   Birmingham and UA at Huntsville in 2012-2013. Residents participated
   individually and in teams. Participants accessed daily questions and
   tracked their online leaderboard competition scores through any
   internet-enabled device. We completed focus groups to assess participant
   acceptance and analysed software use, retention of knowledge and factors
   associated with loss of participants (attrition).
   Results Acceptance: In focus groups, residents (n=17) reported
   leaderboards were the most important motivator of participation. Use: 16
   427 questions were completed: 28.8\% on Saturdays/Sundays, 53.1\%
   between 17: 00 and 08:00. Retention of knowledge: 1046 paired responses
   (for repeated questions) were collected. Correct responses increased by
   11.9\% (p<0.0001) on retest. Differences per time since question
   introduction, trainee level and style of play were observed. Attrition:
   In ordinal regression analyses, completing more questions (0.80 per 10\%
   increase; 0.70 to 0.93) decreased, while postgraduate year 3 class
   (4.25; 1.44 to 12.55) and non-daily play (4.51; 1.50 to 13.58) increased
   odds of attrition.
   Conclusions Our software-enabled, gamification-based educational
   intervention was well accepted among our millennial learners. Coupling
   software with gamification and analysis of trainee use and engagement
   data can be used to develop strategies to augment learning in
   time-constrained educational settings.}},

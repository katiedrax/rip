Title = {{Assessing the potential use of blockchain technology to improve the
   sharing of public health data in a western Canadian province}},
Journal = {{HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{This exploratory, qualitative study set out to identify the encountered
   and perceived barriers to public health (PH) data sharing in a Canadian
   province with a view to assessing blockchain technology as a potential
   solution. A topic guide was developed, based on previous research in the
   area. This was then utilised for ten in-depth, semi-structured
   interviews with PH professionals between 27 May and 18 June 2019. Each
   stage of research was congruent with the philosophical underpinning of
   Gadamerian hermeneutic phenomenology. The major themes that emerged from
   the data collected were related to the information systems in use, data
   quality and ownership, as well as client identity management. The
   recurring core theme throughout all interviews was related to
   ineffective leadership and management, contributing to each major theme.
   Overwhelmingly the results show that the majority of barriers faced in
   this province are human-related. It is concluded that while blockchain
   technology shows promise for enhancing data sharing in healthcare, it is
   still many years away from being implemented in this Canadian province.
   As the results of this study indicate, there are human related barriers
   that could be addressed in the meantime, which are outside the scope of
   a technical solution. Future work should explore the perspectives of
   other stakeholders, such as the provincial government to fully
   understand the potential for using blockchain to share PH data in this
   province.}},

Title = {{Customer Privacy Concerns as a Barrier to Sharing Data about Energy Use
   in Smart Local Energy Systems: A Rapid Realist Review}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this review is to investigate the nature of privacy
   concerns in the context of smart local energy systems (SLES) to
   understand how SLES providers can minimize both user concerns, and cause
   for concern, around privacy. We conducted a rapid realist review and
   thematic framework analysis against Bronfenbrenner's socio-ecological
   model to understand privacy concerns in different contexts. A common
   privacy concern was that sharing detailed energy use data had the
   potential to reveal information about home life, and to intrude upon
   people's sense of autonomy, choice, and control. Evidence suggests that
   people are willing to accept new data sharing technologies if the
   benefits of doing so are clear, anticipated, and mutually beneficial.
   Building trust, through increasing knowledge and understanding, was a
   mechanism for overcoming privacy concerns, but this was mediated by the
   organization providing the information. Non-profit organizations were
   more trusted to ensure appropriate safeguards to privacy were in place.
   One key barrier to participation with good supporting evidence was that
   people could resist perceived intrusions on their privacy. This could be
   actively resisted by refusing to install data collection technologies or
   passively by non-participation in adapting energy use behaviours: both
   of which are necessary for SLES to achieve their goals of managing
   energy demand and building resilience in smart grids.}},

Title = {{Molecular medicine tumor board: whole-genome sequencing to inform on
   personalized medicine for a man with advanced prostate cancer}},
Journal = {{PROSTATE CANCER AND PROSTATIC DISEASES}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Molecular profiling of cancer is increasingly common as part of
   routine care in oncology, and germline and somatic profiling may provide
   insights and actionable targets for men with metastatic prostate cancer.
   However, all reported cases are of deidentified individuals without full
   medical and genomic data available in the public domain. Patient and
   methods We present a case of whole-genome tumor and germline sequencing
   in a patient with advanced prostate cancer, who has agreed to make his
   genomic and clinical data publicly available. Results We describe an
   84-year-old Caucasian male with a Gleason 10 oligometastastic
   hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Whole-genome sequencing provided
   insights into his tumor's underlying mutational processes and the
   development of an SPOP mutation. It also revealed an androgen-receptor
   dependency of his cancer which was reflected in his durable response to
   radiation and hormonal therapy. Potentially actionable genomic lesions
   in the tumor were identified through a personalized medicine approach
   for potential future therapy, but at the moment, he remains in
   remission, illustrating the hormonal sensitivity of his SPOP-driven
   prostate cancer. We also placed this patient in the context of a large
   prostate-cancer cohort from the PCAWG (Pan-cancer Analysis of Whole
   Genomes) group. In this comparison, the patient's cancer appears typical
   in terms of the number and type of somatic mutations, but it has a
   somewhat larger contribution from the mutational process associated with
   aging. Conclusion We combined the expertise of medical oncology and
   genomics approaches to develop a molecular tumor board to integrate the
   care and study of this patient, who continues to have an outstanding
   response to his combined modality treatment. This identifiable case
   potentially helps overcome barriers to clinical and genomic data
   sharing.}},

Title = {{Barriers and facilitators to PDMP IS Success in the US: A systematic
   review}},
Journal = {{DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{219}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP) help prevent
   prescription drug misuse and promote appropriate pain management.
   Despite these benefits and PDMP mandates in most states, PDMPs face
   challenges that hinder their success. This paper uses the Delone and
   McLean Information Success (IS) Model to review the current literature
   for barriers and facilitators to PDMP quality, use, intention to use and
   user satisfaction in the United States (U.S.).
   Material and Methods: Scopus, PubMed and Embase databases were searched
   due to their relevance to information technology, education and
   research.
   Results: There were 142 and 183 barriers and facilitators, respectively,
   found in 44 peer reviewed articles. Barriers to PDMP quality, use and
   user satisfaction include lack of interstate data sharing, access
   difficulties, lack of time, inability to delegate access, lack of
   knowledge or awareness of the PMDP, and lack of EHR integration.
   Facilitators to PDMP quality, use and user satisfaction include
   interstate data connections, real-time data updates, EHR integration,
   and access delegation.
   Discussion: Interstate data sharing, EHR integration and expanding
   access to delegates were common themes found. Some results were found to
   be contradictory such as mandating use.
   Conclusion: PDMP users can use these findings to assess current barriers
   to PDMP success in the U.S. and draw possible solutions from the list of
   facilitators. Practitioners should consider the context of their state
   and organization when determining which facilitators would most promote
   PDMP IS success. Combining facilitators may be the best route to PDMP IS
   success in certain situations.}},

Title = {{Privacy-preserving data mining for open government data from
   heterogeneous sources}},
Journal = {{GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Open data is a global movement with the potential to generate
   significant social and economic benefits. Policies on open government
   data (OGD) inspire the development of new and innovative services that
   government agencies may lack. The International Open Data Charter
   adequately describes the importance of data mining. Governments that
   have signed this charter should focus on the following areas-(i) data
   mining, (ii) linkage, and (iii) in-depth analysis, i.e., distribution of
   open data that is freely accessible for elaborate analysis using machine
   reading. However, a series of practical difficulties is observed in
   connection with the data mining of OGD for in-depth analysis. First,
   most OGD do not have identifiers to prevent privacy disclosure. Second,
   owing to the nature of siloed data, the data sharing and collection
   methods vary with respect to heterogeneous OGD, and administrative or
   institutional barriers need to be overcome. This has created a demand
   for a novel technical solution that applies micro-aggregation and
   distance-based record linkage to address the aforementioned issues.
   Thus, in this study, a method capable of integrating two or more
   de-identified OGDs into one dataset to enable OGD data mining is
   proposed. In addition, the proposed method allows users to adjust the
   privacy threshold level to determine an appropriate balance between
   privacy disclosure risk and data utility. The effectiveness of the
   method is evaluated in terms of several metrics via extensive
   experimentation. This study emphasizes the importance of the research on
   efficient utilization of already-published OGDs, which has been
   relatively neglected in the past. Further, it broadens the research area
   for privacy-preserving data mining by proposing a method capable of
   mining heterogeneous data even in the absence of identifiers.}},

   harnesses the power of technology to connect users to their primary
   health data sources, the medical community, and researchers. By syncing
   with existing patient portals, health data can be stored on the Backpack
   Health platform and easily accessed and controlled by users in one
   connected interface. Individuals manage and collate their current and
   past conditions, genetic test results, symptoms, medications,
   procedures, labs, and other health data. Users are empowered to
   disseminate their information to clinicians, researchers, foundations,
   and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies they connect with through
   the Backpack Health application. Here, we describe how two rare disease
   advocacy groups, The Marfan Foundation and Project Alive, utilize
   Backpack Health to connect with their target populations. Through secure
   transfer of pseudonymized data, groups can query their members to
   improve understanding of clinical features and to facilitate meaningful
   research. Responses to the groups' surveys show strong member engagement
   with high completion rates and increases in new Backpack Health users
   when surveys are deployed. Data from these surveys have been published

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Opioid use and misuse are continued issues facing clinicians across all
   aspects of health care. As clinicians struggle to effectively manage
   opioid prescribing, pharmacogenomics (PGx) further offers the prescriber
   an improved ability to understand the potential for an individual
   patient's genetics to influence opioid efficacy and safety. When PGx
   data are available at the point of initial prescribing, clinicians can
   apply that data to drug therapy selection. However, barriers continue to
   exist relative to PGx data sharing and interpretation, which have
   created difficulties for widespread PGx implementation. This article
   briefly describes potential barriers to PGx data integration, strategies
   to overcome those barriers, and the potential positive effect of
   successful data sharing on opioid prescribing.
   Prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) have been successfully
   operationalized to share controlled substance prescribing data across
   health care settings. Such data sharing enables clinicians to, among
   other things, better understand risks associated with misuse. Because a
   relatively limited volume of PGx data is currently pertinent to opioid
   prescribing, such PGx data could be added to PDMPs as a way to
   communicate genetic information within current technology platforms. Not
   only would this integrate into existing clinical workflow models where
   PDMP data are accessed at this point of prescribing and/or dispensing,
   but associated clinical guidance for PGx data interpretation in the
   context of opioids could be integrated into the workflow process. Such
   clinical decision support could be provided directly through the PDMP
   interface for uniformity or could be provided via systems that access
   PDMP data. Clinical, economic, and policy implications of the inclusion
   of PGx data within PDMPs are also discussed. Through harnessing PDMP for
   data sharing, multiple barriers to PGx implementation could be
   mitigated, and clinicians may have better access to PGx data to optimize
   opioid prescribing.}},

   Methods Durham County, the City of Durham in North Carolina, Durham
   health systems and other stakeholders have developed a data-sharing
   model to inform local community health efforts. Aggregated health system
   data obtained through clinical encounters are shared publicly, providing
   data on the prevalence of health conditions of interest to the

   Results A community-owned web platform called the Durham Neighborhood
   Compass provides aggregate health data (e.g. on diabetes, heart disease,
   stroke and other conditions of interest) in the context of neighborhood
   social (e.g. income distribution, education level, demographics) and

Title = {{Progress and prospects for data-driven coordinated management and
   emergency response: the case of Ireland}},
Journal = {{TERRITORY POLITICS GOVERNANCE}},
Abstract = {{Internationally, there is a drive to make coordinated management and
   emergency response (CMER) more data-driven and centralized through
   shared data infrastructures and control centres. While there are a few
   well-known case examples of data-driven CMER, in general it has been
   partially implemented. In this paper, we highlight the importance of
   historical institutional and spatial context and path dependencies in
   shaping the development of CMERs within and across jurisdictions. We
   examine the progress and prospects of data-driven CMER in Ireland, with
   respect to the general landscape of inter-agency cooperation and with
   reference to a single key agency: An Garda Siochana (AGS), the Irish
   police force. To do so, we draw on 36 in-depth interviews with key
   stakeholders and a critical discourse analysis of 15 key
   policy/guideline documents. Our analysis reveals the ways in which
   embedded institutional cultures, structures and working practices, which
   are relatively resistant to change, have thwarted data-sharing and
   data-driven analysis and decision-making. These factors act as barriers
   to the adoption of smart-city approaches more generally, not just in
   Ireland but globally.}},

Title = {{From bits to bites: Advancement of the Germinate platform to support
   prebreeding informatics for crop wild relatives}},
Journal = {{CROP SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Management and distribution of experimental data from prebreeding
   projects is important to ensure uptake of germplasm into breeding and
   research programs. Being able to access and share this data in standard
   formats is essential. The adoption of a common informatics platform for
   crops that may have limited resources brings economies of scale,
   allowing common informatics components to be used across multiple
   species. The close integration of such a platform with commonly used
   breeding software, visualization, and analysis tools reduces the barrier
   for entry to researchers and provides a common framework to facilitate
   collaborations and data sharing. This work presents significant updates
   to the Germinate platform and highlights its value in distributing
   prebreeding data for 14 crops as part of the project `Adapting
   Agriculture to Climate Change: Collecting, Protecting and Preparing Crop
   Wild Relatives' (hereafter Crop Trust Crop Wild Relatives project) led
   by the Crop Trust (https://www.cwrdiversity.org). The addition of data
   on these species compliments data already publicly available in
   Germinate. We present a suite of updated Germinate features using
   examples from these crop species and their wild relatives. The use of
   Germinate within the Crop Trust Crop Wild Relatives project demonstrates
   the usefulness of the system and the benefits a shared informatics
   platform provides. These data resources provide a foundation on which
   breeding and research communities can develop additional online
   resources for their crops, harness new data as it becomes available, and
   benefit collectively from future developments of the Germinate platform.}},

Journal = {{HEALTH \& SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY}},
Abstract = {{Despite the increasing policy focus on integrated dementia care in the
   UK, little is known about the opportunities and challenges encountered
   by practitioners charged with implementing these policies on the ground.
   We undertook an extensive, mixed-methods analysis of how a contemporary
   multidisciplinary dementia pathway in the UK was experienced and
   negotiated by service providers. Our pragmatic mixed methods design
   incorporated three types of research interaction with practitioners: (a)
   Semi-structured interviews (n = 31) and focus group discussions (n = 4),
   (b) Practitioner `shadowing' observations (n = 19), and (c) Service
   attendance and performance metrics reviews (n = 8). Through an abductive
   analysis of practitioner narratives and practice observations, we
   evidenced how inter-practitioner prejudices, restrictive and competitive
   commissioning frameworks, barriers to effective data sharing and other
   resource constraints, all challenged integrative dementia care and led
   to unintended consequences such as practice overlap and failure to
   identify and respond to people's needs. In order to more successfully
   realise integrated dementia pathways, we propose innovative
   commissioning frameworks which purposefully seek to diffuse power
   imbalances, encourage inter-provider respect and understanding, and

Journal = {{DATA IN BRIEF}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{31}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Child maltreatment is a serious public health problem. Previous research
   demonstrates that child maltreatment clusters in low-income, racially
   homogenous neighborhoods. Little is known, however, about the structural
   correlates of spatial risk in small areas such as census tracts. Here we
   present additional information regarding the data and methods used in
   the recent article published in Child Abuse \& Neglect entitled
   ``Variability and stability in child maltreatment risk across time and
   space and its association with neighborhood social \& housing
   vulnerability in New Mexico: A Bayesian space-time model{''} {[}1] . The
   present dataset merges child maltreatment data from the New Mexico
   Department of Public Health with multiple sources of publicly available
   data to create a novel public health analysis. Bayesian spatiotemporal
   modeling techniques were used to map the relative risk of substantiated
   child maltreatment across census tracts in the state, and to elucidate
   spatial and temporal heterogeneity in risk. The data was initially
   collected by the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department, the
   state organization that suspected child abuse and neglect cases are
   reported to and the organization that then substantiates these cases.
   The data were then sent to the New Mexico Community Data Collaborative,
   a data analytic organization under the umbrella of the New Mexico
   Department of Health. The point file consisting of home addresses of sub
   stantiated cases of child abuse was then aggregated by census tract,
   mapped for the entire state of New Mexico and made available to the
   public for research and analysis by different public health
   organizations and researchers (including the present researchers). The
   very purpose of making the data available to the public was to allow
   deeper investigations into trends and associations with other social
   determinants of health. This analysis demonstrates the public health
   importance of data sharing and accessibility. (c) 2020 Published by

Abstract = {{The medical and machine learning communities are relying on the promise
   of artificial intelligence (AI) to transform medicine through enabling
   more accurate decisions and personalized treatment. However, progress is
   slow. Legal and ethical issues around unconsented patient data and
   privacy is one of the limiting factors in data sharing, resulting in a
   significant barrier in accessing routinely collected electronic health
   records (EHR) by the machine learning community. We propose a novel
   framework for generating synthetic data that closely approximates the
   joint distribution of variables in an original EHR dataset, providing a
   readily accessible, legally and ethically appropriate solution to
   support more open data sharing, enabling the development of AI
   solutions. In order to address issues around lack of clarity in defining
   sufficient anonymization, we created a quantifiable, mathematical
   definition for ``identifiability{''}. We used a conditional generative
   adversarial networks (GAN) framework to generate synthetic data while
   minimize patient identifiability that is defined based on the
   probability of re-identification given the combination of all data on
   any individual patient. We compared models fitted to our synthetically
   generated data to those fitted to the real data across four independent
   datasets to evaluate similarity in model performance, while assessing
   the extent to which original observations can be identified from the
   synthetic data. Our model, ADS-GAN, consistently outperformed
   state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrated reliability in the joint
   distributions. We propose that this method could be used to develop
   datasets that can be made publicly available while considerably lowering
   the risk of breaching patient confidentiality.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{Developing or independently evaluating algorithms in biomedical research
   is difficult because of restrictions on access to clinical data. Access
   is restricted because of privacy concerns, the proprietary treatment of
   data by institutions (fueled in part by the cost of data hosting,
   curation, and distribution), concerns over misuse, and the complexities
   of applicable regulatory frameworks. The use of cloud technology and
   services can address many of the barriers to data sharing. For example,
   researchers can access data in high performance, secure, and auditable
   cloud computing environments without the need for copying or
   downloading. An alternative path to accessing data sets requiring
   additional protection is the model-to-data approach. In model-to-data,
   researchers submit algorithms to run on secure data sets that remain
   hidden. Model-to-data is designed to enhance security and local control
   while enabling communities of researchers to generate new knowledge from
   sequestered data. Model-to-data has not yet been widely implemented, but
   pilots have demonstrated its utility when technical or legal constraints
   preclude other methods of sharing. We argue that model-to-data can make
   a valuable addition to our data sharing arsenal, with 2 caveats. First,
   model-to-data should only be adopted where necessary to supplement
   rather than replace existing data-sharing approaches given that it
   requires significant resource commitments from data stewards and limits
   scientific freedom, reproducibility, and scalability. Second, although
   model-to-data reduces concerns over data privacy and loss of local
   control when sharing clinical data, it is not an ethical panacea. Data
   stewards will remain hesitant to adopt model-to-data approaches without
   guidance on how to do so responsibly. To address this gap, we explored
   how commitments to open science, reproducibility, security, respect for
   data subjects, and research ethics oversight must be re-evaluated in a
   model-to-data context.}},

Abstract = {{This work provides an overview of a Spanish survey on research data,
   which was carried out within the framework of the project Datasea at the
   beginning of 2015. It is covered by the objectives of sustainable
   development (goal 9) to support the research. The purpose of the study
   was to identify the habits and current experiences of Spanish
   researchers in the health sciences in relation to the management and
   sharing of raw research data. Method: An electronic questionnaire
   composed of 40 questions divided into three blocks was designed. The
   three Section s contained questions on the following aspects: (A)
   personal information; (B) creation and reuse of data; and (C)
   preservation of data. The questionnaire was sent by email to a list of
   universities in Spain to be distributed among their researchers and
   professors. A total of 1063 researchers completed the questionnaire.
   More than half of the respondents (54.9\%) lacked a data management
   plan; nearly a quarter had storage systems for the research group;
   81.5\% used personal computers to store data; ``Contact with
   colleagues{''} was the most frequent means used to locate and access
   other researchers' data; and nearly 60\% of researchers stated their
   data were available to the research group and collaborating colleagues.
   The main fears about sharing were legal questions (47.9\%), misuse or
   interpretation of data (42.7\%), and loss of authorship (28.7\%). The
   results allow us to understand the state of data sharing among Spanish
   researchers and can serve as a basis to identify the needs of
   researchers to share data, optimize existing infrastructure, and promote
   data sharing among those who do not practice it yet.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{(1) Background: The availability of research datasets can strengthen and
   facilitate research processes. This is specifically relevant in the
   emergency medicine field due to the importance of providing immediate
   care in critical situations as the very current Coronavirus (COVID-19)
   Pandemic is showing to the scientific community. This work aims to show
   which Emergency Medicine journals indexed in Journal Citation Reports
   (JCR) currently meet data sharing criteria. (2) Methods: This study
   analyzes the editorial policies regarding the data deposit of the
   journals in the emergency medicine category of the JCR and evaluates the
   Supplementary material of the articles published in these journals that
   have been deposited in the PubMed Central repository. (3) Results: It
   has been observed that 19 out of the 24 journals contained in the
   emergency medicine category of Journal Citation Reports are also located
   in PubMed Central (PMC), yielding a total of 5983 articles. Out of
   these, only 9.4\% of the articles contain supplemental material.
   Although second quartile journals of JCR emergency medicine category
   have quantitatively more articles in PMC, the main journals involved in
   the deposit of supplemental material belong to the first quartile, of
   which the most used format in the articles is pdf, followed by text

   an incipient practice in the emergency medicine field, as there are
   still barriers between researchers to participate in data sharing.
   Therefore, it is necessary to promote dynamics to improve this practice
   both qualitatively (the quality and format of datasets) and

Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAY 29}},
Abstract = {{Background The integration of community health and social care services
   has been widely promoted nationally as a vital step to improve patient
   centred care, reduce costs, reduce admissions to hospital and facilitate
   timely and effective discharge from hospital. The complexities of
   integration raise questions about the practical challenges of
   integrating health and care given embedded professional and
   organisational boundaries in both sectors. We describe how an English
   city created a single, integrated care partnership, to integrate
   community health and social care services. This led to the development
   of 12 integrated neighbourhood teams, combining and co-locating
   professionals across three separate localities. The aim of this research
   is to identify the context and the factors enabling and hindering
   integration from a qualitative process evaluation. Methods Twenty-four
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with equal numbers of health
   and social care staff at strategic and operational level. The data was
   subjected to thematic analysis. Results We describe three key themes: 1)
   shared vision and leadership; 2) organisational factors; 3) professional
   workforce factors. We found a clarity of vision and purpose of
   integration throughout the partnership, but there were challenges
   related to the introduction of devolved leadership. There were
   widespread concerns that the specified outcome measures did not capture
   the complexities of integration. Organisational challenges included a
   lack of detail around clinical and service delivery planning, tensions
   around variable human resource practices and barriers to data sharing. A
   lack of understanding and trust meant professional workforce integration
   remained a key challenge, although integration was also seen as a
   potential solution to engender relationship building. Conclusions Given
   the long-term national policy focus on integration this ambitious
   approach to integrate community health and social care has highlighted
   implications for leadership, organisational design and
   inter-professional working. Given the ethos of valuing the local assets
   of individuals and networks within the new partnership we found the
   integrated neighbourhood teams could all learn from each other. Many of
   the challenges of integration could benefit from embracing the inherent
   capabilities across the integrated neighbourhood teams and localities of
   this city.}},

Title = {{Developing a strategy to improve data sharing in health research: A
   mixed-methods study to identify barriers and facilitators}},
Journal = {{HEALTH INFORMATION MANAGEMENT JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   Data sharing presents new opportunities across the spectrum of research
   and is vital for science that is open, where data are easily
   discoverable, accessible, intelligible, reproducible, replicable and
   verifiable. Despite this, it is yet to become common practice. Global
   efforts to develop practical guidance for data sharing and open access
   initiatives are underway, however evidence-based studies to inform the
   development and implementation of effective strategies are lacking.
   Objective:
   This study sought to determine the barriers and facilitators to data
   sharing among health researchers and to identify the target behaviours
   for designing a behaviour change intervention strategy.
   Method:
   Data were drawn from a cross-sectional survey of data management
   practices among health researchers from one Australian research
   institute. Determinants of behaviour were theoretically derived using
   well-established behavioural models.
   Results:
   Data sharing practices have been described for 77 researchers, and 6
   barriers and 4 facilitators identified. The primary barriers to data
   sharing included perceived negative consequences and lack of competency
   to share data. The primary facilitators to data sharing included trust
   in others using the data and social influence related to public benefit.
   Intervention functions likely to be most effective at changing target

   Conclusion:
   Results of this study provide a theoretical and evidence-based process
   to understand the behavioural barriers and facilitators of data sharing
   among health researchers.
   Implications:
   Designing interventions that specifically address target behaviours to
   promote data sharing are important for open researcher practices.}},

Abstract = {{The Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe (INSPIRE) Directive
   (2007) requires public organisations across Europe to share
   environmentally-related spatial datasets to support decision making and
   management of the environment. Despite the environmental focus of
   INSPIRE, it offers limited guidance for archaeological datasets. Most
   primary data is created outside, but ultimately curated within, the
   public sector. As spatial evidence from fieldwork activities is not
   considered by the Directive, it overlooks a range of barriers to sharing
   data, such as project-based fieldwork, a lack of data standards, and
   formatting and licencing variations. This paper submits that these
   challenges are best addressed through the formalised management of
   primary research data through an archaeological Spatial Data
   Infrastructure (SDI). SDIs deliver more efficient data management and
   release economic value by saving time and money. Better stewardship of
   archaeological data will also lead to more informed research and
   stewardship of the historic environment. ARIADNE already provides a
   digital infrastructure for research data, but the landscape and spatial
   component has been largely overlooked. However, rather than developing a
   separate solution, the full potential of spatial data from
   archaeological research can and should be realised through ARIADNE.}},

Abstract = {{Background and purpose: Access to healthcare data is indispensable for
   scientific progress and innovation. Sharing healthcare data is
   time-consuming and notoriously difficult due to privacy and regulatory
   concerns. The Personal Health Train (PHT) provides a privacy-by-design
   infrastructure connecting FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
   Reusable) data sources and allows distributed data analysis and machine
   learning. Patient data never leaves a healthcare institute.
   Materials and methods: Lung cancer patient-specific databases (tumor
   staging and post-treatment survival information) of oncology departments
   were translated according to a FAIR data model and stored locally in a
   graph database. Software was installed locally to enable deployment of
   distributed machine learning algorithms via a central server. Algorithms
   (MATLAB, code and documentation publicly available) are patient
   privacy-preserving as only summary statistics and regression
   coefficients are exchanged with the central server. A logistic
   regression model to predict post-treatment two-year survival was trained
   and evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), root
   mean square prediction error (RMSE) and calibration plots.
   Results: In 4 months, we connected databases with 23 203 patient cases
   across 8 healthcare institutes in 5 countries (Amsterdam, Cardiff,
   Maastricht, Manchester, Nijmegen, Rome, Rotterdam, Shanghai) using the
   PHT. Summary statistics were computed across databases. A distributed
   logistic regression model predicting post-treatment two-year survival
   was trained on 14 810 patients treated between 1978 and 2011 and
   validated on 8 393 patients treated between 2012 and 2015.
   Conclusion: The PHT infrastructure demonstrably overcomes patient
   privacy barriers to healthcare data sharing and enables fast data
   analyses across multiple institutes from different countries with
   different regulatory regimens. This infrastructure promotes global
   evidence-based medicine while prioritizing patient privacy. (C) 2019 The

Journal = {{BRITISH COLUMBIA MEDICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patients diagnosed with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, also
   known as 22q11DS or DiGeorge syndrome, have a diverse array of
   congenital anomalies and chronic health conditions. Because no study has
   reported on the coordination of multidisciplinary health services in
   British Columbia required by individuals with 22q11DS, we set out to
   determine which health care services these patients access and what
   barriers in health informatics affect institutional and provincial data
   sharing.
   Methods: A retrospective review of patient care at BC Children's
   Hospital (BCCH) was conducted using the provincial discharge abstract
   database and databases from hospital specialty services involved in the
   care of patients with 22q11DS. Data were collected for patients seen at
   the hospital from April 2001 to March 2018. This 17-year review
   considered patient age at diagnosis, distribution of patient ages within
   the study cohort, number and type of specialty services accessed, and
   length of follow-up.
   Results: A total of 293 patients with 22q11DS were identified from the
   hospital discharge abstract databases (DAD) and seven BCCH specialty
   clinic databases. Data could not be retrieved from some clinic databases
   due to coding and reporting discrepancies, which prevented the
   amalgamation of data from all hospital specialty services. Data from the
   DAD and seven BC Children's Hospital specialty services were then
   amalgamated, and duplicates were removed to identify 293 unique patients
   with 22q11DS. On average, patients accessed five services, with 13 new
   patients being seen each year and followed for an average of 7 years.
   Most of the pediatric care was provided by the Cleft Palate/Craniofacial
   Program, Cardiology, Endocrinology, and Otolaryngology. Using BC Women's
   Hospital Medical Genetics 22q11DS data (n = 400), we were able to
   corroborate the size of our study cohort and to estimate the prevalence
   of 22q11DS in BC for the study period.
   Conclusions: Barriers to data retrieval and sharing at institutional and
   provincial levels were found to limit care coordination for patients
   with 22q11DS, who require ongoing, complex, multidisciplinary
   management. Incongruent and incomplete data systems in BC are hindering
   our ability to provide this coordinated care and plan transition,
   leaving us without the evidence needed by provincial health care
   providers, local experts, policymakers, and national and international
   22q11DS research centres.}},

Abstract = {{Data sharing can be defined as the release of research data that can be
   used by others. With the recent open-science movement, there has been a
   call for free access to data, tools and methods in academia. In recent
   years, subject-based and institutional repositories and data centres
   have emerged along with online publishing. Many scientific records,
   including published articles and data, have been made available via new
   platforms. In the United Kingdom, most major research funders had a data
   policy and require researchers to include a `data-sharing plan' when
   applying for funding. However, there are a number of barriers to the
   full-scale adoption of data sharing. Those barriers are not only
   technical, but also psychological and social. A survey was conducted
   with over 1800 UK-based academics to explore the extent of support of
   data sharing and the characteristics and factors associated with
   data-sharing practice. It found that while most academics recognised the
   importance of sharing research data, most of them had never shared or
   reused research data. There were differences in the extent of data
   sharing between different gender, academic disciplines, age and
   seniority. It also found that the awareness of Research Council UK's
   (RCUK) Open-Access (OA) policy, experience of Gold and Green OA
   publishing, attitudes towards the importance of data sharing and
   experience of using secondary data were associated with the practice of
   data sharing. A small group of researchers used social media such as
   Twitter, blogs and Facebook to promote the research data they had shared
   online. Our findings contribute to the knowledge and understanding of
   open science and offer recommendations to academic institutions,

Abstract = {{The sharing of clinical trial data and biomarker data sets among the

   Through data sharing, a better understanding of current therapies in
   terms of their efficacy, safety and biomarker data profiles can be
   achieved. However, the sharing of these data sets involves a number of
   stakeholder groups including patients, researchers, private industry,
   scientific journals and professional societies. Each of these
   stakeholder groups has differing interests in the use and sharing of
   clinical trial and biomarker data, and the conflicts caused by these
   differing interests represent significant obstacles to effective,

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{16816-16829}},
Abstract = {{Unlike traditional industrial robots, indoor service robots are usually
   required to possess high intelligence, such as the skills of flexible
   moving, precise spacial perceiving. And high intelligence is always
   accompanied by consuming complicated and expensive computation
   resources. One solution for indoor service robots is centralization of
   expensive computation resource so that it is possible to design a low
   cost client with a high-intelligence brain. However, as a fundamental
   intelligence function for mobile indoor robots, if a real-time visual
   Simultaneously Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) system is split into
   client and brain, it will be confronted with new challenges, such as the
   barrier of instant data sharing and performance degradation brought by
   network delay inbetween. To solve the problem, we focus on a framework
   and approach of cloud-based visual SLAM in this paper, and provide an
   efficient solution to offload the expensive computation and reduce the
   cost of robot clients. The integrated system is distributed in a 3-level
   Cloud with light-weight tracking, high precision dense mapping, and map
   sharing. Based on recent excellent algorithms, our system is able to run
   a real-time sparse tracking on the client, and a real-time dense mapping
   on the cloud server, which outputs an explicit 3D dense map. Only
   keyframes are sent to the local cloud center to reduce the network
   bandwidth requirement. Dense geometric pose estimation besides
   feature-based methods is computed to make the system resistant to
   feature-less indoor scenes. The camera poses associated with keyframes
   are optimized on the local computing cloud center, and are sent back to
   the client to decrease the trajectory drift. We evaluate the system on
   the Technical University of Munich (TUM) datasets, Imperial College
   London and National University of Ireland Maynooth (ICL-NUIM) datasets,
   and the real data captured by our robot in terms of visual odometry on
   the client side and dense maps generated on the server cloud.
   Qualitative and quantitative experiments show our cloud visual SLAM
   system is able to bear the network delay in Local Area Network (LAN),
   and it is an efficient vSLAM solution for indoor service robots with
   high intelligence from a centric brain.}},

Title = {{Factors influencing harmonized health data collection, sharing and
   linkage in Denmark and Switzerland: A systematic review}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   The digitalization of medicine has led to a considerable growth of
   heterogeneous health datasets, which could improve healthcare research
   if integrated into the clinical life cycle. This process requires,
   amongst other things, the harmonization of these datasets, which is a
   prerequisite to improve their quality, re-usability and
   interoperability. However, there is a wide range of factors that either
   hinder or favor the harmonized collection, sharing and linkage of health
   data.
   Objective
   This systematic review aims to identify barriers and facilitators to
   health data harmonization-including data sharing and linkage-by a
   comparative analysis of studies from Denmark and Switzerland.
   Methods
   Publications from PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and CINAHL involving
   cross-institutional or cross-border collection, sharing or linkage of
   health data from Denmark or Switzerland were searched to identify the
   reported barriers and facilitators to data harmonization.
   Results
   Of the 345 projects included, 240 were single-country and 105 were
   multinational studies. Regarding national projects, a Swiss study
   reported on average more barriers and facilitators than a Danish study.
   Barriers and facilitators of a technical nature were most frequently
   reported.
   Conclusion
   This systematic review gathered evidence from Denmark and Switzerland on
   barriers and facilitators concerning data harmonization, sharing and
   linkage. Barriers and facilitators were strictly interrelated with the
   national context where projects were carried out. Structural changes,
   such as legislation implemented at the national level, were mirrored in
   the projects. This underlines the impact of national strategies in the
   field of health data. Our findings also suggest that more openness and
   clarity in the reporting of both barriers and facilitators to data
   harmonization constitute a key element to promote the successful
   management of new projects using health data and the implementation of
   proper policies in this field. Our study findings are thus meaningful
   beyond these two countries.}},

Abstract = {{Earth observation data sharing is an essential part of the data
   lifecycle and plays a critical role in Earth science research. Existing
   industry data sharing systems are affected by restrictions in
   distributed resource management and tightly coupled service
   interoperability. These systems currently offer no support for
   facilitating cross-disciplinary exploration and application. The lack of
   a national data sharing infrastructure has led to reduced international
   cooperation. These barriers are common and have hindered the development
   of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). The China
   GEOSS Data Sharing Network (China GEOSS DSNet) has been proposed as a
   part of China's Plan for Implementing GEOSS (2016-2025) to address the
   above issues. In this research, we designed a national GEOSS data
   sharing framework, including resource integration mechanism,
   sharing-oriented metadata standards, and lightweight interoperability
   service to coordinate various Earth observation resources. So far, more
   than 29 million archived satellite metadata records and 200 TB of
   high-quality satellite datasets have been integrated under this
   framework. The results were demonstrated in the following applications:
   domestic satellite archived metadata query service, international Earth
   observation resource sharing service, and disaster emergency response
   service.}},

   Statistics.
   Setting Acute hospital trusts in the NHS in England.
   Participants All adult patients resident in England that had one or more
   inpatient, outpatient or accident and emergency encounters at acute NHS

   Results 21 286 873 patients were involved in 121 351 837 encounters at
   152 included trusts. 117 (77.0\%) hospital trusts were using electronic
   health records (EHR). There was limited regional alignment of EHR
   systems. On 11 017 767 (9.1\%) occasions, patients attended a hospital
   using a different health record system to their previous hospital
   attendance. 15 736 863 (73.9\%) patients had two or more encounters with
   the included trusts and 3 931 255 (25.0\%) of those attended two or more
   trusts. Over half (53.6\%) of these patients had encounters shared
   between just 20 pairs of hospitals. Only two of these pairs of trusts
   used the same EHR system.
   Conclusions Each year, millions of patients in England attend two or
   more different hospital trusts. Most of the pairs of trusts that
   commonly share patients do not use the same record systems. This
   research highlights significant barriers to inter-hospital data sharing

Abstract = {{Objectives To explore whether the Screen and Treat Programme to support
   United Kingdom citizens potentially affected by terrorist attacks in
   Tunisia (2015), Paris (2015) and Brussels (2016) was effective in
   identifying and referring people to mental health services, to examine
   the programme's acceptability to users and to understand how agencies
   involved worked together. Methods Individuals offered screening by the
   programme (n = 529) were invited to participate in the study and were
   sent a questionnaire. Follow-up interviews were conducted with
   questionnaire respondents who consented and with employees of agencies
   involved in the programme's planning and delivery. Seventy-seven people
   affected by the attacks completed questionnaires, 35 of those were also
   interviewed, and 1 further person only participated in an interview.
   Eleven people from agencies organizing and delivering the programme and
   five clinician-managers were also interviewed. Results Most service
   users said the attacks had a major impact on their lives. Many reported
   anxiety, depression, difficulty going out or travelling, sleep problems,
   panic attacks, flashbacks and hyper-vigilance. A third had reduced their
   working hours and a similar proportion had taken sick leave. Two-thirds
   sought help from their General Practitioner (GP) before being contacted
   by the programme, but almost all thought their GP had not been helpful
   in dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or referring to
   appropriate care. Several people were prescribed psychotropic
   medication; only a few were referred to mental health professionals.
   Many participants used help offered by organizations external to
   National Health Service, with mixed experiences. Waiting times for
   treatment varied from no delay to a few months. Most interviewees
   thought the programme should have started sooner and provided more
   information about sources of support. Most users found treatment
   received via the programme helpful. Professionals involved in organizing
   and delivering the programme thought that bureaucratic delays in setting
   it up were key limitations on effectiveness. Clinician interviewees
   thought an outreach approach was needed to identify at-risk individuals.
   Conclusions Users who took part in the programme were satisfied with
   their treatment, although many thought it should have been offered
   sooner. Funding and data sharing between agencies were the main barriers
   to timely contact with affected individuals. Self-referral, GP
   identification of PTSD and GP referral to appropriate care were regarded
   as ineffective, suggesting that people affected by similar future
   incidents should be supported better and assisted more promptly to
   access treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Despite ongoing efforts to increase diversity of cohorts in
   precision medicine research (PMR), little is known about the obstacles
   to inclusion of blind people and those with low vision ({''}the blind
   community{''}) in PMR. The blind community comprises similar to 10\% of
   the US adult population and its members commonly experience health
   disparities. Understanding barriers to inclusion of this community is
   necessary to facilitate their participation.
   Methods: An online survey was developed in disability-accessible
   formats. Key questions included views on PMR; willingness to
   participate, provide data, and engage in the study; data sharing and
   consent; and perceived barriers to participation. Analyses describe
   results for all participants.
   Results: Two hundred seventy-one blind/low-vision participants completed
   the survey. Participants expressed strong support for PMR, and
   willingness to participate in PMR, to provide lifestyle, biological and
   medical information, to engage with the study, and to have their data
   shared with other researchers. Preferences for data sharing and consent
   models varied. Significantly, 65\% identified 3-6 barriers to
   participation, particularly inaccessible transportation, clinics, and
   facilities; inaccessible information; and attitudinal and institutional
   barriers.
   Conclusion: Removing the identified barriers is key. Measures that could
   increase inclusivity of blind people and those with low vision in PMR
   are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Background: ``Data to Care{''} (D2C) is a public health strategy that
   uses surveillance and other data to improve continuity of HIV care for
   persons with HIV (PWH) by identifying those who are in need of medical
   care or other services and facilitating linkage to these services. The
   primary goal of D2C is to increase the number of PWH who are engaged in
   care and virally suppressed.
   Methods: Data to Care can be implemented using several approaches.
   Surveillance-based D2C is usually initiated by health departments, using
   HIV surveillance and other data to identify those not in care. Health
   care providers may also initiate D2C by identifying patients who may
   have fallen out of care and working collaboratively with health
   departments to investigate, locate, and relink the patients to medical
   care or other needed services.
   Results: Although D2C is a relatively new strategy, health department
   D2C programs have reported both promising results (eg, improved
   surveillance data quality and successful linkage to or re-engagement in
   care for PWH) and challenges (eg, incomplete or inaccurate data in
   surveillance systems, barriers to data sharing, and limitations of
   existing data systems).
   Conclusions: Data to Care is expected to enable health departments to
   move closer toward achieving national HIV prevention goals. However,
   additional information on appropriate implementation practices at each
   step of the D2C process is needed. This JAIDS Special Supplement
   explores how CDC funding to state health departments (eg, technical
   assistance and demonstration projects), and partnerships across federal
   agencies, are advancing our knowledge of D2C.}},

   sessions at ECR 2015-2018. The survey was approved by the ESR research
   committee, was administered online, and chi-square tests were used.
   Results The overall response rate was 29\% (132/460). Responses were
   received from institutions in 29 countries. These institutions reported
   having conducted 429 trials, leading to 332 publications, of which 43\%
   were first and 44\% were last authorships by those institutions. For
   future trials, 98\% of respondents (93/95) said they would be interested
   in sharing data, although only 34\% had shared data already (23/68, p <
   0.001). The major barriers to data sharing were data protection (78\%,
   74/95), ethical issues (49\%, 47/95), and the lack of a data sharing
   platform (49\%, 47/95). Of the respondents, 89\% believed a platform
   would facilitate data sharing (85/95 vs. 10/95 did not, p < 0.001) and
   should offer easy data uploading (74\%, 70/95), data safety (66\%,

   and data access policies (56\%, 53/95). Conclusion A considerable number
   of imaging trials are being performed and published by radiologists in

Abstract = {{Background: Diagnosis requires that clinicians communicate and share
   patient information in an efficient manner. Advances in electronic
   health records (EHRs) and health information technologies have created
   both challenges and opportunities for such communication.
   Methods: We conducted a multi-method, focused ethnographic study of
   physicians on general medicine inpatient units in two teaching
   hospitals. Physician teams were observed during and after morning rounds
   to understand workflow, data sharing and communication during diagnosis.
   To validate findings, interviews and focus groups were conducted with
   physicians. Field notes and interview/focus group transcripts were
   reviewed and themes identified using content analysis.
   Results: Existing communication technologies and EHR-based data sharing
   processes were perceived as barriers to diagnosis. In particular,
   reliance on paging systems and lack of face-to-face communication among
   clinicians created obstacles to sustained thinking and discussion of
   diagnostic decision-making. Further, the EHR created data overload and
   data fragmentation, making integration for diagnosis difficult. To
   improve diagnosis, physicians recommended replacing pagers with two-way
   communication devices, restructuring the EHR to facilitate access to key
   information and improving training on EHR systems.
   Conclusions: As advances in health information technology evolve,
   challenges in the way clinicians share information during the diagnostic
   process will rise. To improve diagnosis, changes to both the technology
   and the way in which we use it may be necessary.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focusses on biological hazards at the global level and
   considers the challenges to risk assessment (RA) from a One Health
   perspective. Two topics - vector-borne diseases (VBD) and antimicrobial
   resistance (AMR) - are used to illustrate the challenges ahead and to
   explore the opportunities that new methodologies such as next-generation
   sequencing can offer. Globalisation brings complexity and introduces
   drivers for infectious diseases. Cooperation and the application of an
   integrated RA approach - one that takes into consideration food farming
   and production systems including social and environmental factors - are
   recommended. Also needed are methodologies to identify emerging risks at
   a global level and propose prevention strategies. AMR is one of the
   biggest threats to human health in the infectious disease environment.
   Whereas new genomic typing techniques such as whole genome sequencing
   (WGS) provide further insights into the mechanisms of spread of
   resistance, the role of the environment is not fully elucidated, nor is
   the role of plants as potential vehicles for spread of resistance.
   Historical trends and recent experience indicate that (re)-emergence
   and/or further spread of VBD within the EU is a matter of when rather
   than if. Standardised and validated vector monitoring programs are
   required to be implemented at an international level for continuous
   surveillance and assessment of potential threats. There are benefits to
   using WGS - such as a quicker and better response to outbreaks and
   additional evidence for source attribution. However, significant
   challenges need to be addressed, including method standardisation and
   validation to fully realise these benefits; barriers to data sharing;
   and establishing epidemiological capacity for cluster triage and

Abstract = {{Objective The West African Disaster Preparedness Initiative held a
   disaster preparedness tabletop exercise with representatives from the
   Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in November 2015. The
   tabletop exercise was hosted by the Republic of Ghana's National
   Disaster Management Organization and partners in Accra, Ghana. Methods
   ECOWAS Commission delegates and representatives from 10 member states
   were confronted with a series of simulated crises. Participants utilized
   existing national preparedness plans and web-based information
   technologies to research and communicate about internal disaster threats
   and those from neighboring countries. After each of the exercise's three
   phases, facilitators distributed participant surveys. Results A total of
   106 individuals participated in the tabletop exercise. During the
   exercise, national teams utilizing well-developed disaster contingency
   plans and emergency operations center (EOC) standard operating
   procedures (SOPs) reached out to help less-prepared national teams. Key
   issues identified in the survey were language and cultural issues as
   barriers, effectiveness of disaster management agencies linked to heads
   of state, and the need for data sharing and real-time communication for
   situational awareness and multisector coordination. Conclusion This
   tabletop exercise helped improve and refine the ECOWAS regional and
   member states' national SOPs that teams will employ to prepare for,
   respond to, and recover from future disasters. (Disaster Med Public

Abstract = {{The Asian Prostate Cancer (A-CaP) study is an Asia-wide initiative that
   was launched in December 2015 in Tokyo, Japan, with the objective of
   surveying information about patients who have received a
   histopathological diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) and are undergoing
   treatment and clarifying distribution of staging, the actual status of
   treatment choices, and treatment outcomes. The study aims to clarify the
   clinical situation for PCa in Asia and use the outcomes for the purposes
   of international comparison. Following the first meeting in Tokyo in
   December 2015, the second A-CaP meeting was held in Seoul, Korea, in
   September 2016. This, the third A-CaP meeting, was held on October 14,
   2017, in Chiang Mai, Thailand, with the participation of members and
   collaborators from 12 countries and regions. In the meeting,
   participating countries and regions presented the current status of data
   collection, and the A-CaP office presented a preliminary analysis of the
   registered cases received from each country and region. Participants
   discussed ongoing challenges relating to data input and collection,
   institutional, and legislative issues that may present barriers to data
   sharing, and the outlook for further patient registrations through to
   the end of the registration period in December 2018. In addition to
   A-CaP-specific discussions, a series of special lectures were also
   delivered on the situation for health insurance in the United States,
   the correlation between insurance coverage and PCa outcomes, and the
   outlook for robotic surgery in the Asia-Pacific region. Members also
   confirmed the principles of authorship in collaborative studies, with a
   view to publishing original articles based on A-CaP data in the future.

Title = {{Behavioral Health Integration With Primary Care: Implementation
   Experience and Impacts From the State Innovation Model Round 1 States}},
Journal = {{MILBANK QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{97}},

Pages = {{543-582}},

Abstract = {{Policy Points
   Individuals with behavioral health (BH) conditions comprise a medically
   complex population with high costs and high health care needs.
   Considering national shortages of BH providers, primary care providers
   serve a critical role in identifying and treating BH conditions and
   making referrals to BH providers. States are increasingly seeking ways
   to address BH conditions among their residents. States funded by the
   Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under the first round of the
   State Innovation Models (SIM) Initiative all invested in BH integration.
   States found sharing data among providers, bridging professional
   divides, and overcoming BH provider shortages were key barriers.
   Nonetheless, states made significant strides in integrating BH care.
   Beyond payment models, a key catalyst for change was facilitating
   informal relationships between BH providers and primary care physicians.
   Infrastructure investments such as promoting data sharing by connecting
   BH providers to a health information exchange and providing tailored
   technical assistance for both BH and primary care providers were also
   important in improving integration of BH care. Context Increasing
   numbers of states are looking for ways to address behavioral health (BH)
   conditions among their residents. The first round of the State
   Innovation Models (SIM) Initiative provided financial and technical
   support to six states since 2013 to test the ability of state
   governments to lead health care system transformation. All six SIM
   states invested in integration of BH and primary care services. This
   study summarizes states' progress, challenges, and lessons learned on BH
   integration. Additionally, the study reports impacts on expenditure,
   utilization, and quality-of-care outcomes for persons with BH conditions
   across four SIM states. Methods We use a mixed-methods design, drawing
   on focus groups and key informant interviews to reach conclusions on
   implementation and quantitative analysis using Medicaid claims data to
   assess impact. For three Medicaid accountable care organization (ACO)
   models funded under SIM, we used a difference-in-differences regression
   model to compare outcomes for model participants with BH conditions and
   an in-state comparison group before-and-after model implementation. For
   the behavioral health home (BHH) model in Maine, we used a pre-post
   design to assess how outcomes for model participants changed over time.
   Findings Informal relationship building, tailored technical assistance,
   and the promotion of data sharing were key factors in making progress.
   After three years of implementation, the growth in total expenditures
   was less than the comparison group by \$128 (-\$253, -\$3; p < 0.10) and
   \$62 (-\$87, -\$36; p < 0.001) per beneficiary per month for
   beneficiaries with BH conditions attributed to an ACO in Minnesota and
   Vermont, respectively. Likewise, there were reductions in emergency
   department use for ACO participants in all three states after two to
   four years of implementation. However, there was no improvement in
   BH-related quality metrics for ACO beneficiaries in all three states.
   Although participants in the BHH model had increased expenditures after
   two years of implementation, use of primary care and specialty care
   services increased by 3\% and 8\%, respectively, and antidepressant
   medication adherence also improved. Conclusions The SIM Round 1 states
   made considerable progress in integrating BH and primary care services,
   and there were promising findings for all models.
   Taken together, there is some evidence that Medicaid payment models can
   improve patterns of care for beneficiaries with BH conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives This article utilizes an adapted model for research transfer
   to highlight the important role of Local Public Health Agencies (LPHAs)
   to share data more effectively with local community organizations to
   advance health equity.
   Methods A literature review related to public health data sharing with
   local community partners was conducted using Medline, Embase, and CINAHL
   databases and grey literature sources with 12 articles included for
   analysis. Six LPHAs distributed an online survey to 405 local community
   organizations to define their current data uses and needs. Survey and
   literature review findings informed a one-day deliberative dialogue
   event with 19 participants who brought multiple perspectives together on
   the bathers and potential solutions for data sharing.
   Results Results are discussed utilizing the three stages of data
   sharing: awareness, communication, and collaboration. Awareness of the
   barriers and needs of community partners related to data, and the public
   health core competency of assessment and analysis is the first stage.
   More effective is the second stage, where LPHAs proactively communicate
   to understand and meet the needs of community partners. Data sharing is
   the most effective when LPHAs use the third stage of collaboration to
   work with community partners to mutually benefit from data sharing.
   Conclusion When LPHAs utilize their core competencies of assessment and
   analysis, communication, and collaboration to share data with community
   partners, they are able to share data more effectively. This allows
   community partners to modify programs to better serve priority
   populations and improve population health.}},

Abstract = {{Background: A steady increase in HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) has been
   demonstrated globally in individuals initiating first-line
   antiretroviral therapy (ART). To support effective use of ART and
   prevent spread of HIVDR, monitoring is essential. Aim: We piloted a
   surveillance system for transmitted HIVDR to assess the feasibility of
   implementation at the European level. Method: All 31 countries in the
   European Union and European Economic Area were invited to
   retrospectively submit data on individuals newly diagnosed with HIV in
   2015 who were tested for antiviral susceptibility before ART, either as
   case-based or as aggregate data. We used the Stanford HIV database
   algorithm to translate genetic sequences into levels of drug resistance.
   Results: Nine countries participated, with six reporting case-based data
   on 1,680 individuals and four reporting aggregated data on 1,402 cases.
   Sequence data were available for 1,417 cases: 14.5\% of individuals (n =
   244) showed resistance to at least one antiretroviral drug. In
   case-based surveillance, the highest levels of transmitted HIVDR were
   observed for non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)
   with resistance detected in 8.6\% (n = 145), followed by resistance to
   nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) (5.1\%; n = 85) and
   protease inhibitors (2.0\%; n = 34). Conclusion: We conclude that
   standard reporting of HIVDR data was feasible in the participating
   countries. Legal barriers for data sharing, consensus on definitions and
   standardisation of interpretation algorithms should be clarified in the
   process of enhancing European-wide HIV surveillance with drug resistance

Abstract = {{Electronic Health Records (EHR) contain extensive information on various
   health outcomes and risk factors, and therefore have been broadly used
   in healthcare research. Integrating EHR data from multiple clinical
   sites can accelerate knowledge discovery and risk prediction by
   providing a larger sample size in a more general population which
   potentially reduces clinical bias and improves estimation and prediction
   accuracy. To overcome the barrier of patient-level data sharing,
   distributed algorithms are developed to conduct statistical analyses
   across multiple sites through sharing only aggregated information. The
   current distributed algorithm often requires iterative information
   evaluation and transferring across sites, which can potentially lead to
   a high communication cost in practical settings. In this study, we
   propose a privacy-preserving and communication-efficient distributed
   algorithm for logistic regression without requiring iterative
   communications across sites. Our simulation study showed our algorithm
   reached comparative accuracy comparing to the oracle estimator where
   data are pooled together. We applied our algorithm to an EHR data from
   the University of Pennsylvania health system to evaluate the risks of
   fetal loss due to various medication exposures.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL DEVICES-EVIDENCE AND RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {{101-127}},
Abstract = {{Connected drug delivery devices are increasingly being developed to
   support patient supervision and counseling in home setting. Features may
   include dosing reminders, adherence trackers, tools for patient
   education, and patient diaries to collect patient-reported outcomes, as
   well as monitoring tools with interfaces between patients and health
   care professionals (HCPs). Five connected devices have been selected as
   the basis for a review of the clinical evidence concerning the impact of
   electronic tools on treatment adherence and efficacy outcomes. Disease
   areas covered include multiple sclerosis, diabetes, hypertension, liver
   and renal transplant recipients, tuberculosis, hepatitis C, clinically
   isolated syndrome, asthma, and COPD. From studies comparing the use of
   electronic feedback tools to standard of care, there is an initial
   evidence for a higher adherence to treatment and better outcomes among
   patients who use the electronic tools. To substantiate the assumption
   that connected devices can improve adherence in an outpatient setting
   over a prolonged period of time, further data from controlled randomized
   studies are required. Key barriers to the broader adoption of connected
   devices include data privacy laws that may prevent data sharing with
   HCPs in some countries, as well as the need to demonstrate that the
   tools are consistently used and generate a high-quality and reproducible
   database. If these challenges can be addressed in a way that is
   agreeable to all stakeholders, it is expected that the future value of
   connected devices will be to 1) facilitate and improve patient
   involvement in disease management in a flexible care setting, 2) enable
   early treatment decisions, and 3) complement value-based reimbursement

Journal = {{PREVENTIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{118}},
Pages = {{59-65}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{All fifty states have implemented prescription drug monitoring programs
   (PDMPs) to reduce misuse and diversion of controlled drugs. Interstate
   PDMP data sharing has been called for by clinical practitioners, but
   evidence to support the effectiveness of PDMP data sharing is lacking.
   This study examined whether PDMP interstate data sharing with bordering
   states was associated with prescriptions of opioids. This was a
   cross-sectional study that included patients with non-cancer chronic
   pain from the 2014 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (weighted N =
   66,198,751; unweighted N = 2846). Multinomial logistic regression was
   performed to examine the association between PDMP interstate data
   sharing status and patients' being prescribed opioids for pain
   treatment, controlling for covariates guided by the Eisenberg's model of
   physician decision-making. Findings indicated that patients residing in
   states with interstate PDMP data sharing with all or partial bordering
   states were not less likely to be prescribed opioids compared to those
   living in states without interstate data sharing. Other factors such as
   patient age, health insurance type, new patient status, and physician
   adoption of electronic medical records were associated with the
   likelihood of patients' being prescribed opioids. This study concluded
   that current practice of interstate PDMP data sharing with bordering
   states was not associated with patients' being prescribed opioids for
   non-cancer chronic pain treatment. Future studies and policy efforts
   that unravel technological, legal, and political barriers to reciprocal
   and equal interstate data sharing with bordering states should be
   warranted to inform PDMP redesign and in turn, augment overall PDMP
   effectiveness in reducing misuse of prescription opioids.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the ability of electronic health record (EHR)
   data extracted into a data-sharing system to accurately identify
   contraceptive use.
   Study design: We compared rates of contraceptive use from electronic
   extraction of EHR data via a data-sharing system and manual abstraction
   of the EHR among 142 female patients ages 15-49 years from a family
   medicine clinic within a primary care practice-based research network
   (PBRN). Cohen's kappa coefficient measured agreement between electronic
   extraction and manual abstraction.
   Results: Manual abstraction identified 62\% of women as contraceptive
   users, whereas electronic extraction identified only 27\%. Long acting
   reversible (LARC) methods had 96\% agreement (Cohen's kappa 0.78;
   confidence interval, 0.57-0.99) between electronic extraction and manual
   abstraction. EHR data extracted via a data-sharing system was unable to
   identify barrier or over-the-counter contraceptives.
   Conclusions: Electronic extraction found substantially lower overall
   rates of contraceptive method use, but produced more comparable LARC
   method use rates when compared to manual abstraction among women in this
   study's primary care clinic. Implications: Quality metrics related to

Abstract = {{Maritime industries routinely collect critical environmental data needed
   for sustainable management of marine ecosystems, supporting both the
   blue economy and future growth. Collating this information would provide
   a valuable resource for all stakeholders. For the North Sea, the oil and
   gas industry has been a dominant presence for over 50 years that has
   contributed to a wealth of knowledge about the environment. As the
   industry begins to decommission its offshore structures, this
   information will be critical for avoiding duplication of effort in data
   collection and ensuring best environmental management of offshore
   activities. This paper summarises the outcomes of a Blue Growth Data
   Challenge Workshop held in 2017 with participants from: the oil and gas
   industry; the key UK regulatory and management bodies for oil and gas
   decommissioning; open access data facilitators; and academic and
   research institutes. Here, environmental data collection and archiving
   by oil and gas operators in the North Sea are described, alongside how
   this compares to other offshore industries; what the barriers and
   opportunities surrounding environmental data sharing are; and how wider
   data sharing from offshore industries could be achieved. Five primary
   barriers to data sharing were identified: 1) Incentives, 2) Risk
   Perception, 3) Working Cultures, 4) Financial Models, and 5) Data
   Ownership. Active and transparent communication and collaboration
   between stakeholders including industry, regulatory bodies, data portals
   and academic institutions will be key to unlocking the data that will be
   critical to informing responsible decommissioning decisions for offshore
   oil and gas structures in the North Sea.}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The vast majority of scientific articles published to-date have not been
   accompanied by concomitant publication of the underlying research data
   upon which they are based. This state of affairs precludes the routine
   re-use and re-analysis of research data, undermining the efficiency of
   the scientific enterprise, and compromising the credibility of claims
   that cannot be independently verified. It may be especially important to
   make data available for the most influential studies that have provided
   a foundation for subsequent research and theory development. Therefore,
   we launched an initiativethe Data Arkto examine whether we could
   retrospectively enhance the preservation and accessibility of important
   scientific data. Here we report the outcome of our efforts to retrieve,
   preserve, and liberate data from 111 of the most highly-cited articles
   published in psychology and psychiatry between 2006-2011 (n = 48) and
   2014-2016 (n = 63). Most data sets were not made available (76/111,
   68\%, 95\% CI {[}60,77]), some were only made available with
   restrictions (20/111,18\%, 95\% CI {[}10, 27]), and few were made
   available in a completely unrestricted form (15/111,14\%, 95\% CI {[}5,
   22]). Where extant data sharing systems were in place, they usually
   (17/22,77\%, 95\% CI {[}54,91 ]) did not allow unrestricted access.
   Authors reported several barriers to data sharing, including issues
   related to data ownership and ethical concerns. The Data Ark initiative

   barriers to data sharing, and advance community discussions on data

Abstract = {{Purpose:Patient portals (PPs) provide patients access to their
   electronic health record and may facilitate active engagement in their
   care. Because PP use has not been well studied among patients with
   cancer, we sought to: understand the willingness of patients with cancer
   to use the PP, identify barriers to PP use, and improve PP
   accessibility.Materials and Methods:As part of an institutional quality
   improvement initiative, we used a stakeholder-driven approach to examine
   PP use at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA). We conducted a
   survey across all ambulatory oncology practices as well as staff and
   patient focus groups in one ambulatory practice. We deployed three
   interventions to address barriers: staff education, staff-assisted
   enrollment support, and independent enrollment support.Results:In
   October 2015, 1,019 (87\%) of 1,178 eligible patients completed the
   survey (PP enrolled, 57\%; non-PP enrolled, 43\%). PP-enrolled patients
   reported reviewing test results and appointment schedules.
   Non-PP-enrolled patients cited difficult PP enrollment, lack of computer
   access, and concern about sharing data electronically as barriers to PP
   enrollment. Focus groups (staff, n = 20; patient representatives, n = 5)
   also identified lack of awareness of PP benefits as a barrier. The
   interventions, deployed from November to December 2015, increased PP
   enrollment from 47\% to 53\% by January 2016.Conclusion:Patients with
   cancer want to communicate with their team through the PP, but barriers
   to enrollment impede use. Straightforward system-level interventions may
   increase enrollment. Further work is necessary to ascertain the degree
   to which increased PP enrollment leads to greater engagement and better
   outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Precision medicine, the customization of health care to an individual's
   genetic profile while accounting for biomarkers and lifestyle, has
   increasingly been adopted by health care stakeholders to guide the
   development of treatment options, improve treatment decision making,
   provide more patient-centered care, and better inform coverage and
   reimbursement decisions. Despite these benefits, key challenges prevent
   its broader use and adoption.
   On December 7-8, 2017, the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy convened a
   group of stakeholders to discuss these challenges and provide
   recommendations to facilitate broader adoption and use of precision
   medicine across health care settings. These stakeholders represented the
   pharmaceutical industry, clinicians, patient advocacy, private payers,
   device manufacturers, health analytics, information technology,
   academia, and government agencies.
   Throughout the 2-day forum, participants discussed evidence requirements
   for precision medicine, including consistent ways to measure the utility
   and validity of precision medicine tests and therapies, limitations of
   traditional clinical trial designs, and limitations of value assessment
   framework methods. They also highlighted the challenges with evidence
   collection and data silos in precision medicine. Interoperability within
   and across health systems is hindering clinical advancements. Current
   medical coding systems also cannot account for the heterogeneity of many
   diseases, preventing health systems from having a complete understanding
   of their patient population to inform resource allocation. Challenges
   faced by payers, such as evidence limitations, to inform coverage and
   reimbursement decisions in precision medicine, as well as legal and
   regulatory barriers that inhibit more widespread data sharing, were also
   identified.
   While a broad range of perspectives was shared throughout the forum,
   participants reached consensus across 2 overarching areas. First, there
   is a greater need for common definitions, thresholds, and standards to
   guide evidence generation in precision medicine. Second, current
   information silos are preventing the sharing of valuable data.
   Collaboration among stakeholders is needed to support better information
   sharing, awareness, and education of precision medicine for patients.
   The recommendations brought forward by this diverse group of experts
   provide a set of solutions to spur widespread use and application of
   precision medicine. Taken together, successful adoption and use of
   precision medicine will require input and collaboration from all sectors
   of health care, especially patients. Copyright (C) 2018, Academy of

   determinants of adverse medical device event reporting: secondary
   analysis of qualitative interview data}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{JUN 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Post-market surveillance of medical devices is reliant on
   physician reporting of adverse medical device events (AMDEs). Few
   studies have examined factors that influence whether and how physicians
   report AMDEs, an essential step in the development of behaviour change
   interventions. This study was a secondary analysis comparing application
   of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Tailored
   Implementation for Chronic Diseases (TICD) framework to identify
   potential behaviour change interventions that correspond to determinants
   of AMDE reporting.
   Methods: A previous study involving qualitative interviews with Canadian
   physicians that implant medical devices identified themes reflecting
   AMDE reporting determinants. In this secondary analysis, themes that
   emerged from the primary analysis were independently mapped to the TDF
   and TICD. Determinants and corresponding intervention options arising
   from both frameworks (and both mappers) were compared.
   Results: Both theoretical frameworks were useful for identifying
   interventions corresponding to behavioural determinants of AMDE
   reporting. Information or education strategies that provide evidence
   about AMDEs, and audit and feedback of AMDE data were identified as
   interventions to target the theme of physician beliefs; improving
   information systems, and reminder cues, prompts and awards were
   identified as interventions to address determinants arising from the
   organization or systems themes; and modifying financial/non-financial
   incentives and sharing data on outcomes associated with AMDEs were
   identified as interventions to target device market themes. Numerous
   operational challenges were encountered in the application of both
   frameworks including a lack of clarity about how directly relevant to
   themes the domains/determinants should be, how many domains/determinants
   to select, if and how to resolve discrepancies across multiple mappers,
   and how to choose interventions from among the large number associated
   with selected domains/determinants.
   Conclusions: Given discrepancies in mapping themes to
   determinants/domains and the resulting interventions offered by the two
   frameworks, uncertainty remains about how to choose interventions that
   best match behavioural determinants in a given context. Further research
   is needed to provide more nuanced guidance on the application of TDF and
   TICD for a broader audience, which is likely to increase the utility and
   uptake of these frameworks in practice.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{136-142}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 130
   million people are in constant need of humanitarian assistance due to
   natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and conflicts, among other
   factors. These health crises can compromise the resilience of healthcare
   systems, which are essential for achieving the health objectives of the
   sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN). During
   a humanitarian health crisis, rapid and informed decision making is
   required. This is often challenging due to information scarcity, limited
   resources, and strict time constraints. Moreover, the traditional
   approach to digital health development, which involves a substantial
   requirement analysis, a feasibility study, and deployment of technology,
   is ill-suited for many crisis contexts. The emergence of Web 2.0
   technologies and social media platforms in the past decade, such as
   Twitter, has created a new paradigm of massive information and
   misinformation, in which new technologies need to be developed to aid
   rapid decision making during humanitarian health crises.
   Objective: Humanitarian health crises increasingly require the analysis
   of massive amounts of information produced by different sources, such as
   social media content, and, hence, they are a prime case for the use of
   artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to help identify relevant
   information and make it actionable. To identify challenges and
   opportunities for using AI in humanitarian health crises, we reviewed
   the literature on the use of AI techniques to process social media.
   Methodology: We performed a narrative literature review aimed at
   identifying examples of the use of AI in humanitarian health crises. Our
   search strategy was designed to get a broad overview of the different
   applications of AI in a humanitarian health crisis and their challenges.
   A total of 1459 articles were screened, and 24 articles were included in
   the final analysis.
   Results: Successful case studies of AI applications in a humanitarian
   health crisis have been reported, such as for outbreak detection. A
   commonly shared concern in the reviewed literature is the technical
   challenge of analyzing large amounts of data in real time. Data
   interoperability, which is essential to data sharing, is also a barrier
   with regard to the integration of online and traditional data sources.
   Human and organizational aspects that might be key factors for the
   adoption of AI and social media remain understudied. There is also a
   publication bias toward high-income countries, as we identified few
   examples in low-income countries. Further, we did not identify any
   examples of certain types of major crisis, such armed conflicts, in
   which misinformation might be more common.
   Conclusions: The feasibility of using AI to extract valuable information
   during a humanitarian health crisis is proven in many cases. There is a
   lack of research on how to integrate the use of AI into the work-flow
   and large-scale deployments of humanitarian aid during a health crisis.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Genetic information of pathogens is an essential input for infectious
   disease control, public health and for research. Efficiency in

   innovation cycle reflecting how they affect the range of surveillance,
   innovation, and sharing activities. Four main barrier categories were
   found: compliance to regulations, negative consequences, self-interest,
   and insufficient incentives for compliance. When grouped in sectors
   (research institutes, public health organizations, supra-national
   organizations and industry) stakeholders appear to have similar
   interests, more than when grouped in domains (human, veterinary and
   food). Considering the innovation process, most of barriers could be
   mapped to the initial stages of the innovation cycle as sampling and
   sequencing phases. These are stages of primary importance to outbreak
   control and public health response. A minority of barriers applied to
   later stages in the innovation cycle, which are of more importance to
   product development.
   Conclusion
   Overall, barriers are complex and entangled, due to the diversity of
   causal factors and their crosscutting features. Therefore, barriers must
   be addressed in a comprehensive and integrated manner. Stakeholders have
   different interests highlighting the diversity in motivations for
   sharing pathogen data: prioritization of public health, basic research,
   economic welfare and/or innovative capacity. Broad inter-sectorial
   discussions should start with the alignment of these interests within
   sectors. The improved sharing of pathogen data, especially in upstream
   phases of the innovation process, will generate substantial public
   health benefits through increased availability of data to inform
   surveillance systems, as well as to allow the (re-) use of data for the
   development of medical countermeasures to control infectious diseases.}},

Title = {{Identifying Barriers to Collaboration Between Primary Care and Public
   Health: Experiences at the Local Level}},
Journal = {{PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Interest is increasing in collaborations between public
   health and primary care to address the health of a community. Although
   the understanding of how these collaborations work is growing, little is
   known about the barriers facing these partners at the local level. The
   objective of this study was to identify barriers to collaboration
   between primary care and public health at the local level in 4 states.
   Methods: The study team, which comprised 12 representatives of
   Practice-Based Research Networks (networks of practitioners interested
   in conducting research in practice-based settings), identified 40 key
   informants from the public health and primary care fields in Colorado,
   Minnesota, Washington State, and Wisconsin. The key informants
   participated in standardized, semistructured telephone interviews with 8
   study team members in 2014 and 2015. Interviews were audio recorded and
   transcribed verbatim. We analyzed key themes and subthemes by drawing on
   grounded theory.
   Results: Primary care and public health participants identified similar
   barriers to collaboration. Barriers at the institutional level included
   the challenges of the primary care environment, in which providers feel
   overwhelmed and resources are tight; the need for systems change; a lack
   of partnership; and geographic challenges. Barriers to collaboration
   included mutual awareness, communication, data sharing, capacity, lack
   of resources, and prioritization of resources.
   Conclusions: Some barriers to collaboration (eg, changes to health care
   billing, demands on provider time) require systems change to overcome,
   whereas others (eg, a lack of shared priorities and mutual awareness)
   could be addressed through educational approaches, without adding
   resources or making a systemic change. Overcoming these common barriers
   may lead to more effective collaboration.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Health and health-related data collected as part of clinical
   care is a foundational component of quality improvement and research.
   While the importance of these data is widely recognized, there are many
   challenges faced by researchers attempting to use such data. It is
   crucial to acknowledge and identify barriers to improve data sharing and
   access practices and ultimately optimize research capacity.
   Objective: To better understand the current state, explore
   opportunities, and identify barriers, an environmental scan of
   investigators at BC Children's Hospital Research Institute (BCCHR) was
   conducted to elucidate current local practices around data access and
   usage.
   Methods: The Clinical and Community Data, Analytics and Informatics
   group at BCCHR comprises over 40 investigators with diverse expertise
   and interest in data who share a common goal of facilitating data
   collection, usage, and access across the community. Semistructured
   interviews with 35 of these researchers were conducted, and data were
   summarized qualitatively. A total impact score, considering both
   frequency with which a problem occurs and the impact of the problem, was
   calculated for each item to prioritize and rank barriers.
   Results: Three main themes for barriers emerged: the lengthy turnaround
   time before data access (18/35, 51\%), inconsistent and opaque data
   access processes (16/35, 46\%), and the inability to link data (15/35,
   43\%) effectively. Less frequent themes included quality and usability
   of data, ethics and privacy review barriers, lack of awareness of data
   sources, and efforts required duplicating data extraction and linkage.
   The two main opportunities for improvement were data access facilitation
   (14/32, 44\%) and migration toward a single data platform (10/32, 31\%).
   Conclusions: By identifying the current state and needs of the data
   community onsite, this study enables us to focus our resources on
   combating the challenges having the greatest impact on researchers. The
   current state parallels that of the national landscape. By ensuring
   protection of privacy while achieving efficient data access, research
   institutions will be able to maximize their research capacity, a crucial
   step towards achieving the ultimate and shared goal between all
   stakeholders-to better health outcomes.}},

Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{Background: There is growing evidence that supporting self-management of
   Juvenile Arthritis can benefit both patients and professionals. Young
   people with Juvenile Arthritis and their healthy peers increasingly use
   mobile technologies to access information and support in day-to-day
   life. Therefore, a user-led, rigorously developed and evaluated mobile
   app could be valuable for facilitating young people's self-management of
   Juvenile Arthritis.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to seek the views of young
   people with Juvenile Arthritis, their parents or carers, and health care
   professionals (HCPs) as to what should be included in a mobile app to
   facilitate young people's self-management of chronic Juvenile Arthritis.
   Methods: A qualitative approach was adopted with a purposeful sample of
   9 young people aged 10-18 years with Juvenile Arthritis, 8 parents or
   carers, and 8 HCPs involved in their care. Data were gathered through
   semi-structured focus group and individual interviews with young people
   and their parents or carers and HCPs. Interview discussion was
   facilitated through demonstration of four existing health apps to
   explore participants' views on strengths and limitations of these,
   barriers and facilitators to mobile app use, preferred designs,
   functionality, levels of interaction, and data sharing arrangements.
   Data were analyzed using the framework approach
   Results: Analysis revealed three interlinked, overarching themes: (1)
   purpose, (2) components and content, and (3) social support. Despite
   some differences in emphasis on essential content, general agreement was
   found between young people with Juvenile Arthritis their parents or
   carers, and professionals that a mobile app to aid self-management would
   be useful. Underpinning the themes was a prerequisite that young people
   are enabled to feel a sense of ownership and control of the app, and
   that it be an interactive, engaging resource that offers developmentally
   appropriate information and reminders, as well as enabling them to
   monitor their symptoms and access social support.
   Conclusions: Findings justify and pave the way for a future feasibility
   study into the production and preliminary testing of such an app. This
   would consider issues such as compatibility with existing technologies,
   costs, age, and cross-gender appeal as well as resource implications.}},

Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1053-1073}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Open data and data sharing should improve transparency of
   research. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how different
   institutional and individual factors affect the data sharing behavior of
   authors of research articles in sociology and political science.
   Design/methodology/approach Desktop research analyzed attributes of
   sociology and political science journals (n=262) from their websites. A
   second data set of articles (n=1,011; published 2012-2014) was derived
   from ten of the main journals (five from each discipline) and stated
   data sharing was examined. A survey of the authors used the Theory of
   Planned Behavior to examine motivations, behavioral control, and
   perceived norms for sharing data. Statistical tests (Spearman's , (2))
   examined correlations and associations.
   Findings Although many journals have a data policy for their authors (78
   percent in sociology, 44 percent in political science), only around half
   of the empirical articles stated that the data were available, and for
   only 37 percent of the articles could the data be accessed. Journals
   with higher impact factors, those with a stated data policy, and younger
   journals were more likely to offer data availability. Of the authors
   surveyed, 446 responded (44 percent). Statistical analysis indicated
   that authors' attitudes, reported past behavior, social norms, and
   perceived behavioral control affected their intentions to share data.
   Research limitations/implications Less than 50 percent of the authors
   contacted provided responses to the survey. Results indicate that data
   sharing would improve if journals had explicit data sharing policies but
   authors also need support from other institutions (their universities,
   funding councils, and professional associations) to improve data
   management skills and infrastructures.
   Originality/value This paper builds on previous similar research in
   sociology and political science and explains some of the barriers to
   data sharing in social sciences by combining journal policies, published
   articles, and authors' responses to a survey.}},

Abstract = {{Humanitarian action, the process of aiding individuals in situations of
   crises, poses unique information-security challenges due to natural or
   manmade disasters, the adverse environments in which it takes place, and
   the scale and multi-disciplinary nature of the problems. Despite these
   challenges, humanitarian organizations are transitioning towards a
   strong reliance on the digitization of collected data and digital tools,
   which improves their effectiveness but also exposes them to
   computer-security threats. In this paper, we conduct a qualitative
   analysis of the computer-security challenges of the International
   Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a large humanitarian organization
   with over sixteen thousand employees, an international legal
   personality, which involves privileges and immunities, and over 150
   years of experience with armed conflicts and other situations of
   violence worldwide. To investigate the computer security needs and
   practices of the ICRC from an operational, technical, legal, and
   managerial standpoint by considering individual, organizational, and
   governmental levels, we interviewed 27 field workers, IT staff, lawyers,
   and managers. Our results provide a first look at the unique security
   and privacy challenges that humanitarian organizations face when
   collecting, processing, transferring, and sharing data to enable
   humanitarian action for a multitude of sensitive activities. These
   results highlight, among other challenges, the trade-offs between
   operational security and requirements stemming from all stakeholders,
   the legal barriers for data sharing among jurisdictions; especially, the
   need to complement privileges and immunities with robust technological
   safeguards in order to avoid any leakages that might hinder access and
   potentially compromise the neutrality, impartiality, and independence of
   humanitarian action.}},

   the potential path forward could include mandating data sharing for key
   sources, increasing transparency, and improving efficiency by making it
   easier for agencies to share data (including developing standards,

Abstract = {{Geospatial data sharing across organizations is a well-recognized
   challenge. Due to the absence of appropriate space to share geospatial
   assets, they often remain scattered and locked in various sectors of
   Ethiopia, no data sets are maintained and updated regularly, efforts are
   duplicated, and finding the available data set is difficult. Exploiting
   the full socio-economic benefit of geospatial information is thus
   impossible. This paper therefore aimed to assess inter-organizational
   geospatial data sharing challenges; and the possible solutions in
   Ethiopia. Lack of coordination, poor data quality and incompatibility,
   institutional, legal, policy, and technological issues were identified
   as major challenges. ENSDI, already initiated, should be promoted more
   as the collaborative entity meant for effective inter-organizational
   geospatial data sharing. National strategy to hand over informal SDI
   initiatives, clear ENSDI development approach (top down), and investment
   on the building block of ENSDI are suggested for the successful
   execution of ENSDI.}},

Abstract = {{On 13 December 2016, President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act
   ({''}the Act{''}) into law. Many of its provisions support the creation
   of an ``Information Commons,{''} an ecosystem of separate but
   interconnected initiatives that facilitate open and responsible sharing
   of genomic and other data for research and clinical purposes. For
   example, the Act supports the National Institutes of Health in mandating
   data sharing, provides funding and guidance for the large national
   cohort program now known as All of Us, expresses congressional support
   for a global pediatric study network, and strengthens patient access to
   health information. The Act also addresses potential barriers to data
   sharing. For example, it makes the issuance of certificates of
   confidentiality automatic for federally funded research involving
   identifiable, sensitive{''} information and strengthens the associated
   protections. At the same time, the Act exacerbates or neglects several
   challenges, for example, increasing complexity by adding a new
   definition of ``identifiable{''} and failing to address the financial
   sustainability of data sharing and the scope of commercialization. In
   sum, the Act is a positive step, yet there is still much work to be done
   before the goals of broad data sharing and utilization can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Background The utilisation of available cross-European data for
   secondary data analyses on physical activity, sedentary behaviours and
   their underlying determinants may benefit from the wide variation that
   exists across Europe in terms of these behaviours and their
   determinants. Such reuse of existing data for further research requires
   Findable; Accessible; Interoperable; Reusable (FAIR) data management and
   stewardship. We here describe the inventory and development of a
   comprehensive European dataset compendium and the process towards
   cross-European secondary data analyses of pooled data on physical
   activity, sedentary behaviour and their correlates across the life
   course.
   Methods A five-step methodology was followed by the European
   Determinants of Diet and Physical Activity (DEDIPAC) Knowledge Hub,
   covering the (1) identification of relevant datasets across Europe, (2)
   development of a compendium including details on the design, study
   population, measures and level of accessibility of data from each study,
   (3) definition of key topics and approaches for secondary analyses, (4)
   process of gaining access to datasets and (5) pooling and harmonisation
   of the data and the development of a data harmonisation platform.
   Results A total of 114 unique datasets were found for inclusion within
   the DEDIPAC compendium. Of these datasets, 14 were eventually obtained
   and reused to address 10 exemplar research questions. The DEDIPAC data
   harmonisation platform proved to be useful for pooling, but in general,
   harmonisation was often restricted to just a few core (crude) outcome
   variables and some individual-level sociodemographic correlates of these
   behaviours.
   Conclusions Obtaining, pooling and harmonising data for secondary data
   analyses proved to be difficult and sometimes even impossible.
   Compliance to FAIR data management and stewardship principles currently
   appears to be limited for research in the field of physical activity and
   sedentary behaviour. We discuss some of the reasons why this might be
   the case and present recommendations based on our experience.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Tools for survival prediction for non-small cell lung cancer
   (NSCLC) patients treated with chemoradiation or radiation therapy are of
   limited quality. In this work, we developed a predictive model of
   survival at 2 years. The model is based on a large volume of historical
   patient data and serves as a proof of concept to demonstrate the
   distributed learning approach.
   Methods and Materials: Clinical data from 698 lung cancer patients,
   treated with curative intent with chemoradiation or radiation therapy
   alone, were collected and stored at 2 different cancer institutes (559
   patients at Maastro clinic (Netherlands) and 139 at Michigan university
   {[} United States]). The model was further validated on 196 patients
   originating from The Christie (United Kingdon). A Bayesian network model
   was adapted for distributed learning (the animation can be viewed at
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDJFOxpwqEA). Two-year posttreatment
   survival was chosen as the endpoint. The Maastro clinic cohort data are
   publicly available at
   https://www.cancerdata.org/publication/developing-and-validating-surviva
   l-prediction-model-nsclc-patients-through-distributed, and the developed
   models can be found at www.predictcancer.org.
   Results: Variables included in the final model were T and N category,
   age, performance status, and total tumor dose. The model has an area
   under the curve (AUC) of 0.66 on the external validation set and an AUC
   of 0.62 on a 5-fold cross validation. A model based on the T and N
   category performed with an AUC of 0.47 on the validation set,
   significantly worse than our model (P<.001). Learning the model in a
   centralized or distributed fashion yields a minor difference on the
   probabilities of the conditional probability tables (0.6\%); the
   discriminative performance of the models on the validation set is
   similar (P=.26).
   Conclusions: Distributed learning from federated databases allows
   learning of predictive models on data originating from multiple
   institutions while avoiding many of the data-sharing barriers. We
   believe that distributed learning is the future of sharing data in
   health care. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. This is

Abstract = {{Objectives. Participation in clinical and basic science research is
   emphasized in gynecologic oncology training. We sought to identify
   trends in adherence to expected research practices and reasons for
   non-adherence among gynecologic oncology fellows.
   Methods. An anonymous 31-question online survey assessing academic
   behaviors, including IRB compliance, authorship assignment, data
   sharing, and potential barriers to non-adherence was distributed to all
   SGO gynecologic oncology fellow members in July 2016. Descriptive
   statistics and univariate analyses were performed.
   Results. Of 190 members, 35.3\% (n = 67) responded. 73\% (n = 49) of
   respondents reported personal noncompliance and 79.1\% (n = 53) reported
   having witnessed others being non-complaint with at least one expected
   research practice. Areas of compliance failure included changing a
   research question without appropriate IRB amendment (20\%; n = 14),
   conducting research under a nonspecific IRB (13.9\%; n = 9), and
   performing research without IRB approval (6.1\%; n = 4). Longer
   institutional time for IRB approval was significantly associated with
   IRB non-adherence (p < 0.05). First year fellows were more likely to use
   a nonspecific IRB (p = 0.04) or expand a question without amending the
   IRB (p = 0.04). When asked about storage of protected health information
   (PHI) for research, 53\% reported non-secure storage with 17.1\% (n = 6)
   having done so for >1000 patients. Thirty respondents (45.5\%) assigned
   authorship to someone who failed to meet ICMJE criteria and twelve
   (18.5\%) accepted authorship without meeting ICMJE criteria. Most
   commonly cited reasons for non-adherence were: cumbersome IRB processes
   (80.3\%), pressure from senior authors (78.8\%), fear of someone else
   publishing first, (74.2\%) and lack of support navigating appropriate
   research practices (71.2\%).
   Conclusions. Fellow non-compliance with expected research practices is
   high, particularly with regards to secure storage of PHI and appropriate
   authorship assignment. Time-consuming and cumbersome IRB procedures,
   perceived pressure from senior authors, and lack of research support
   contribute to non-adherence. Further support and education of
   gynecologic oncology fellows is needed in order to help address these
   barriers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Research on data sharing from clinical trials has focused on elucidating
   perceptions, barriers, and attitudes among trialists and study
   participants with respect to sharing data. However, little information
   exists regarding utilization or associated publication of articles once
   clinical trial data have been widely shared.
   METHODS
   We analyzed administrative records of investigator requests for data
   access, linked publications, and bibliometrics to describe the use of
   the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute data repository.
   RESULTS
   From January 2000 through May 2016, a total of 370 investigators
   requested data from 1 or more clinical trials. Requests for trial data
   have been increasing, with 195 investigators (53\%) initiating requests
   during the last 4.4 years of the study period. The predominant reason
   for requesting data was post hoc secondary analysis of new questions
   (72\%), followed by analytic or statistical approaches to clinical
   trials (9\%) and meta-analyses or pooled study research (7\%). Of 172
   requests with online project descriptions, only 2 requests were
   initiated for reanalysis of primary-outcome findings. Data from 88 of
   100 available clinical trials were requested at least once, and the
   median time from repository availability to first request was 235 days.
   A total of 277 articles were published on the basis of data from 47
   trials. Citation metrics from 224 articles indicated that half of the
   publications have cumulative citations that rank in the top 34\%
   normalized for subject category and year of publication.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Demand for trial data for secondary analysis has been increasing.
   Requesting data for the a priori purpose of reanalysis or verification
   of original findings was rare.}},

Abstract = {{Background: While next generation sequencing has enhanced our
   understanding of the biological basis of malignancy, current knowledge
   on global practices for sequencing cancer samples is limited. To address
   this deficiency, we developed a survey to provide a snapshot of current
   sequencing activities globally, identify barriers to data sharing and
   use this information to develop sustainable solutions for the cancer
   research community.
   Methods: A multi-item survey was conducted assessing demographics,
   clinical data collection, genomic platforms, privacy/ethics concerns,
   funding sources and data sharing barriers for sequencing initiatives
   globally. Additionally, respondents were asked as to provide the primary
   intent of their initiative (clinical diagnostic, research or
   combination).
   Results: Of 107 initiatives invited to participate, 59 responded
   (response rate = 55\%). Whole exome sequencing (P = 0.03) and whole
   genome sequencing (P = 0.01) were utilized less frequently in clinical
   diagnostic than in research initiatives. Procedures to identify
   cancer-specific variants were heterogeneous, with bioinformatics
   pipelines employing different mutation calling/variant annotation
   algorithms. Measurement of treatment efficacy varied amongst
   initiatives, with time on treatment (57\%) and RECIST (53\%) being the
   most common; however, other parameters were also employed. Whilst 72\%
   of initiatives indicated data sharing, its scope varied, with a number
   of restrictions in place (e.g. transfer of raw data). The largest
   perceived barriers to data harmonization were the lack of financial
   support (P < 0.01) and bioinformatics concerns (e.g. lack of
   interoperability) (P = 0.02). Capturing clinical data was more likely to
   be perceived as a barrier to data sharing by larger initiatives than by
   smaller initiatives (P = 0.01).
   Conclusions: These results identify the main barriers, as perceived by
   the cancer sequencing community, to effective sharing of cancer genomic
   and clinical data. They highlight the need for greater harmonization of
   technical, ethical and data capture processes in cancer sample
   sequencing worldwide, in order to support effective and responsible data
   sharing for the benefit of patients.}},

   and Developments in Record Linkage}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 2}},
Abstract = {{In an era where the volume of structured and unstructured digital data
   has exploded, there has been an enormous growth in the creation of data
   about individuals that can be used for understanding and treating
   disease. Joining these records together at an individual level provides
   a complete picture of a patient's interaction with health services and
   allows better assessment of patient outcomes and effectiveness of
   treatment and services. Record linkage techniques provide an efficient
   and cost-effective method to bring individual records together as
   patient profiles. These linkage procedures bring their own challenges,
   especially relating to the protection of privacy. The development and
   implementation of record linkage systems that do not require the release
   of personal information can reduce the risks associated with record
   linkage and overcome legal barriers to data sharing. Current conceptual
   and experimental privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) models show
   promise in addressing data integration challenges. Enhancing and
   operationalizing PPRL protocols can help address the dilemma faced by
   some custodians between using data to improve quality of life and
   dealing with the ethical, legal, and administrative issues associated
   with protecting an individual's privacy. These methods can reduce the
   risk to privacy, as they do not require personally identifying
   information to be shared. PPRL methods can improve the delivery of
   record linkage services to the health and broader research community.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPATIAL DATA INFRASTRUCTURES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {{62-84}},
Abstract = {{Geospatial data sharing across organisations is a well-recognized
   challenge with multiple facets. Due to the absence of appropriate space
   for the sharing of and access to geospatial assets, these often remain
   scattered and locked within various economic sectors of Ethiopia; this
   means that datasets are not maintained or updated regularly, efforts are
   duplicated, finding available datasets is difficult and there is no
   single reliable version of the data. Exploitation of the full
   socioeconomic benefits of using geospatial information is therefore
   impossible. This paper therefore aims to assess inter-organisational
   geospatial data-sharing challenges and the possible solutions within
   Ethiopia. A lack of coordination between organisations, poor data
   quality and compatibility, institutional, legal, policy, and
   technological issues are identified as major challenges. Ethiopian
   National Spatial Data Infrastructure (ENSDI), which has already been
   introduced, should be further promoted as the collaborative entity for
   effective cross-sectoral geospatial data sharing. A national strategy to
   hand over informal SDI initiatives, building on existing efforts,
   setting clear (top-down) ENSDI development approaches and collaborative
   investments in the building blocks of ENSDI are suggested to enable the
   successful execution of ENSDI as a cross-sectoral geospatial

Title = {{Social science data repositories in data deluge A case study of ICPSR's
   workflow and practices}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{626-649}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Owing to the recent surge of interest in the age of the data
   deluge, the importance of researching data infrastructures is
   increasing. The open archival information system (OAIS) model has been
   widely adopted as a framework for creating and maintaining digital
   repositories. Considering that OAIS is a reference model that requires
   customization for actual practice, this paper aims to examine how the
   current practices in a data repository map to the OAIS environment and
   functional components.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted two focus-group
   sessions and one individual interview with eight employees at the
   world's largest social science data repository, the Interuniversity
   Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). By examining their
   current actions (activities regarding their work responsibilities) and
   IT practices, they studied the barriers and challenges of archiving and
   curating qualitative data at ICPSR.
   Findings - The authors observed that the OAIS model is robust and
   reliable in actual service processes for data curation and data
   archives. In addition, a data repository's workflow resembles digital
   archives or even digital libraries. On the other hand, they find that
   the cost of preventing disclosure risk and a lack of agreement on the
   standards of text data files are the most apparent obstacles for data
   curation professionals to handle qualitative data; the maturation of
   data metrics seems to be a promising solution to several challenges in
   social science data sharing.
   Originality/value - The authors evaluated the gap between a research
   data repository's current practices and the adoption of the OAIS model.
   They also identified answers to questions such as how current
   technological infrastructure in a leading data repository such as ICPSR
   supports their daily operations, what the ideal technologies in those
   data repositories would be and the associated challenges that accompany
   these ideal technologies. Most importantly, they helped to prioritize
   challenges and barriers from the data curator's perspective and to
   contribute implications of data sharing and reuse in social sciences.}},

Journal = {{RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{121}},

Pages = {{459-467}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: One of the major hurdles in enabling personalized medicine is
   obtaining sufficient patient data to feed into predictive models.
   Combining data originating from multiple hospitals is difficult because
   of ethical, legal, political, and administrative barriers associated
   with data sharing. In order to avoid these issues, a distributed
   learning approach can be used. Distributed learning is defined as
   learning from data without the data leaving the hospital.
   Patients and methods: Clinical data from 287 lung cancer patients,
   treated with curative intent with chemoradiation (CRT) or radiotherapy
   (RT) alone were collected from and stored in 5 different medical
   institutes (123 patients at MAASTRO (Netherlands, Dutch), 24 at Jessa
   (Belgium, Dutch), 34 at Liege (Belgium, Dutch and French), 48 at Aachen
   (Germany, German) and 58 at Eindhoven (Netherlands, Dutch)).
   A Bayesian network model is adapted for distributed learning (watch the
   animation: http://youtu.bei nQpqMIuHyOk). The model predicts dyspnea,
   which is a common side effect after radiotherapy treatment of lung
   cancer.
   Results: We show that it is possible to use the distributed learning
   approach to train a Bayesian network model on patient data originating
   from multiple hospitals without these data leaving the individual
   hospital. The AUC of the model is 0.61 (95\%Cl, 0.51-0.70) on a 5-fold
   cross-validation and ranges from 0.59 to 0.71 on external validation
   sets.
   Conclusion: Distributed learning can allow the learning of predictive
   models on data originating from multiple hospitals while avoiding many
   of the data sharing barriers. Furthermore, the distributed learning
   approach can be used to extract and employ knowledge from routine
   patient data from multiple hospitals while being compliant to the
   various national and European privacy laws. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Abstract = {{Teamwork is essential for addressing many of the challenges that arise
   in the coordination and delivery of cancer care, especially for the
   problems that are presented by patients who cross geographic boundaries
   and enter and exit multiple health care systems at various times during
   their cancer care journeys. The problem of coordinating the care of
   patients with cancer is further complicated by the growing number of
   treatment options and modalities, incompatibilities among the vast
   variety of technology platforms that have recently been adopted by the
   health care industry, and competing and misaligned incentives for
   providers and systems. Here we examine the issue of regional care
   coordination in cancer through the prism of a real patient journey. This
   article will synthesize and elaborate on existing knowledge about
   coordination approaches for complex systems, in particular, in general
   and cancer care multidisciplinary teams; define elements of coordination
   derived from organizational psychology and human factors research that
   are applicable to team-based cancer care delivery; and suggest
   approaches for improving multidisciplinary team coordination in regional
   cancer care delivery and avenues for future research. The phenomenon of
   the mobile, multisystem patient represents a growing challenge in cancer
   care. Paradoxically, development of high-quality, high-volume centers of
   excellence and the ease of virtual communication and data sharing by
   using electronic medical records have introduced significant barriers to
   effective team-based cancer care. These challenges urgently require

   surveys, university researchers in other countries were deemed the least
   acceptable group of data users, and a just-completed US survey found a
   marked increase in privacy and security concerns related to data access
   by non-US researchers. Furthermore, diminished support for sharing
   beyond national borders is not unique to the US, although the limited
   data from outside the US suggest variation across countries as well as
   demographic groups. Possible sources of resistance include apprehension
   about privacy and security protections. Strategies for building public
   support include making the affirmative case for global data sharing,
   addressing privacy, security, and other legitimate concerns, and
   investigating public concerns in greater depth.}},

   with professional scientists, their views are included in the literature
   review where four themes are explored: lack of shared disciplinary
   culture, trust, responsibility and controlled access to data, and
   describing data to enable reuse. The findings, presented under these
   themes, revealed that, within APSV, sharing among members is mostly
   generous and uninhibited. Beyond APSV, when online repositories were
   involved, barriers came very strongly into play. Trust was weaker and
   barriers also included issues of data quality, data description, and
   ownership and control. The conclusion is that further investigation of
   these barriers, including the attitudes of professional scientists to

Abstract = {{Health information systems are an important planning and monitoring tool
   for public health services, but may lack information from the private
   health sector. In this fourth article in a series on district
   decision-making for health, we assessed the extent of maternal, newborn
   and child health (MNCH)-related data sharing between the private and
   public sectors in two districts of Uttar Pradesh, India; analysed
   barriers to data sharing; and identified key inputs required for data
   sharing. Between March 2013 and August 2014, we conducted 74 key
   informant interviews at national, state and district levels. Respondents
   were stakeholders from national, state and district health departments,
   professional associations, non-governmental programmes and private
   commercial health facilities with 3-200 beds. Qualitative data were
   analysed using a framework based on a priori and emerging themes.
   Private facilities registered for ultrasounds and abortions submitted
   standardized records on these services, which is compulsory under Indian
   laws. Data sharing for other services was weak, but most facilities
   maintained basic records related to institutional deliveries and
   newborns. Public health facilities in blocks collected these data from a
   few private facilities using different methods. The major barriers to
   data sharing included the public sector's non-standardized data
   collection and utilization systems for MNCH and lack of communication
   and follow up with private facilities. Private facilities feared
   information disclosure and the additional burden of reporting, but were
   willing to share data if asked officially, provided the process was
   simple and they were assured of confidentiality. Unregistered
   facilities, managed by providers without a biomedical qualification,
   also conducted institutional deliveries, but were outside any reporting
   loops. Our findings suggest that even without legislation, the public
   sector could set up an effective MNCH data sharing strategy with private
   registered facilities by developing a standardized and simple system
   with consistent communication and follow up.}},

Abstract = {{Although the rise of big data, open government, and social media imply
   greater data sharing, expectations currently do not match reality as
   many consider data exchange in government to be inadequate. Based on
   prior research, Additionally, the paper distinguishes technical
   management capacity and technical engagement capacity effects on
   agencies' sharing behavior. We test hypotheses predicting sharing
   behavior of municipal government agencies with other agencies and with
   non-government organizations using data from a 2012 national survey of
   U.S. municipal government managers. We find that data sharing with both
   government and non-government organizations is more strongly determined
   by persuasive mechanisms and technical engagement capacity, although
   technical management capacity is also important for sharing with other
   government agencies. Conclusions provide insights for future research
   directions and practice.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing attention is being paid to the importance and potential of
   crowd-sourced data to complement current environmental data-streams
   (i.e. in-situ observations and RS data). In parallel, the diffusion of
   Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) that are interactive and
   easy to use have provided a way forward in facing extreme climatic
   events and the threatening hazards resulting from those. The combination
   of these two trends is referred to as ICT-enabled `citizen
   observatories' of the environment. Nevertheless, the success of these
   citizen observatories hinges on the continued involvement of citizens as
   central actors of these initiatives. Developing strategies to (further)
   engage citizens requires in-depth understanding of the behavioral
   determinants that encourage or impede individuals to collect and share
   environment-related data. This paper takes the case of citizen-sensed
   weather data using Personal Weather Stations (PWSs) and looks at the
   drivers and barriers for sharing such data via online amateur weather
   networks. This is done employing a behavioral science lens that
   considers data sharing a decision and systematically investigates the
   influential factors that affect this decision. The analysis and findings
   are based on qualitative empirical research carried out in the
   Netherlands, United Kingdom and Italy. Subsequently, a model was
   developed that depicts the main drivers and barriers for citizen
   participation in weather observatories. This resulting model can be
   utilized as a tool to develop strategies for further enhancing
   ICT-enabled citizen participation in climatic observations and,
   consequently, in environmental management. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The use of the term big data' has grown substantially over the past
   several decades and is now widespread. In this review, I ask what makes
   data big' and what implications the size, density, or complexity of
   datasets have for the science of human development. A survey of existing
   datasets illustrates how existing large, complex, multilevel, and
   multimeasure data can reveal the complexities of developmental
   processes. At the same time, significant technical, policy, ethics,
   transparency, cultural, and conceptual issues associated with the use of
   big data must be addressed. Most big developmental science data are
   currently hard to find and cumbersome to access, the field lacks a
   culture of data sharing, and there is no consensus about who owns or
   should control research data. But, these barriers are dissolving.
   Developmental researchers are finding new ways to collect, manage,
   store, share, and enable others to reuse data. This promises a future in
   which big data can lead to deeper insights about some of the most
   profound questions in behavioral science. (C) 2016 The Authors. WIREs

Abstract = {{Objectives: Evaluate current data sharing activities of UK publicly
   funded Clinical Trial Units (CTUs) and identify good practices and
   barriers.
   Study Design and Setting: Web-based survey of Directors of 45 UK
   Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC)-registered CTUs.
   Results: Twenty-three (51\%) CTUs responded: Five (22\%) of these had an
   established data sharing policy and eight (35\%) specifically requested
   consent to use patient data beyond the scope of the original trial.
   Fifteen (65\%) CTUs had received requests for data, and seven (30\%) had
   made external requests for data in the previous 12 months. CTUs
   supported the need for increased data sharing activities although
   concerns were raised about patient identification, misuse of data, and
   financial burden. Custodianship of clinical trial data and requirements
   for a CTU to align its policy to their parent institutes were also
   raised. No CTUs supported the use of an open access model for data
   sharing.
   Conclusion: There is support within the publicly funded UKCRC-registered
   CTUs for data sharing, but many perceived barriers remain. CTUs are
   currently using a variety of approaches and procedures for sharing data.
   This survey has informed further work, including development of guidance

   sharing and reuse on the Web, we propose a data cataloguing framework
   called WDFed that combines the strength of both Linked Data and REST.
   WDFed adopts the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) to harmonise database
   metadata, and develops a two-way mapping between DCAT and a RESTful API.
   This framework provides an interoperable middle layer that enables
   humans as well as applications to discover and consume Big Data on the

Abstract = {{Objective: To quantify data sharing trends and data sharing policy
   compliance at the British Medical Journal (BMJ) by analysing the rate of
   data sharing practices, and investigate attitudes and examine barriers
   towards data sharing.
   Design: Observational study.
   Setting: The BMJ research archive.
   Participants: 160 randomly sampled BMJ research articles from 2009 to
   2015, excluding meta-analysis and systematic reviews.
   Main outcome measures: Percentages of research articles that indicated
   the availability of their raw data sets in their data sharing
   statements, and those that easily made their data sets available on
   request.
   Results: 3 articles contained the data in the article. 50 out of 157
   (32\%) remaining articles indicated the availability of their data sets.
   12 used publicly available data and the remaining 38 were sent email
   requests to access their data sets. Only 1 publicly available data set
   could be accessed and only 6 out of 38 shared their data via email. So
   only 7/157 research articles shared their data sets, 4.5\% (95\% CI
   1.8\% to 9\%). For 21 clinical trials bound by the BMJ data sharing
   policy, the per cent shared was 24\% (8\% to 47\%).
   Conclusions: Despite the BMJ's strong data sharing policy, sharing rates
   are low. Possible explanations for low data sharing rates could be: the
   wording of the BMJ data sharing policy, which leaves room for individual
   interpretation and possible loopholes; that our email requests ended up
   in researchers spam folders; and that researchers are not rewarded for
   sharing their data. It might be time for a more effective data sharing
   policy and better incentives for health and medical researchers to share
   their data.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The opening of research data is emerging thanks to the
   increasing possibilities of digital technology. The opening of clinical
   trial (CT) data is a part of this process, expected to have positive
   scientific, ethical, health, and economic impacts thus contributing to
   research integrity. The January 2016 proposal by the International
   Council of Medical Journal Editors triggered ample discussion about CT
   data sharing and reconfirmed the need for an ongoing assessment of its
   dynamics. The IMProving Access to Clinical Trials data (IMPACT)
   Observatory aims to play such a role, and assess the data sharing
   culture, policies, and practices of key players, the impact of their
   interventions on CTs, and contribute to a transformation of research.
   The objective of this paper is to present the IMPACT Observatory as well
   as share some of its preliminary findings.
   Materials and methods: Methods include a scoping study of research,
   surveys, interviews, and an environmental scan of research data
   repositories.
   Results: Our preliminary findings indicate that although opening of CT
   data has not yet been achieved, its evolution is encouraging.
   Initiatives by key players contribute to increasing of CT data sharing,
   and many barriers are shrinking or disappearing.
   Conclusions: The major barrier is the lack of data sharing standards,
   from preparing data for public sharing to its curatorship, findability
   and access. However, experiences accumulated by sharing CT data
   according to ``upon request{''} or ``open{''} mechanisms could inform
   the development of such standards. The Vivli, CORBEL-ECRIN and Open
   Trials projects are currently working in this direction.}},

Abstract = {{Access to raw experimental research data and data reuse is a common
   hurdle in scientific research. Despite the mounting requirements from
   funding agencies that the raw data is deposited as soon as (or even
   before) the paper is published, multiple factors often prevent data from
   being accessed and reused by other researchers. The situation with the
   human genomic data is even more dramatic, since on the one hand human
   genomic data is probably the most important data to share - it lies at
   the heart of efforts to combat major health issues such as cancer,
   genetic diseases, and genetic predispositions for complex diseases like
   heart disease and diabetes. On the other hand, since it is sensitive and
   personal information, it is often exempt from data sharing requirements.
   DNAdigest investigates the barriers for ethical and efficient genomic
   data sharing and engages with all stakeholder groups, including
   researchers, librarians, data managers, software developers, policy
   makers, and the general public interested in genomics. Repositive offers
   services and tools that reduce the barriers for data access and reuse
   for the research community in academia, industry, and clinics. To
   address the most pressing problem for public genomic data: that of data
   discoverability, Repositive has built an online platform (repositive.io)
   providing a single point of entry to find and access available genomic

   for sharing data online, and accessible for all skill levels.
   Research limitations/implications - TAMS Analyzer supports Mac and Linux
   platforms only, so a low-cost software recommendation was made for those
   in Windows environments.
   Practical implications - Librarians can use these tools to address data
   access gaps while promoting library digital collections.
   Social implications - With a greater understanding of data tools,
   librarians can be advisors, collaborators, agents for data culture, and
   relevant participants in digital humanities scholarship.
   Originality/value - The research evaluates both the capabilities of the
   tools and the barriers to using or accessing them, which are often
   neglected. The paper addresses a need in the literature for greater
   scrutiny of tools that are a critical component of the data ecology, and
   will further assist librarians when connecting scholars to tools of
   inquiry in an environment with limited funding and technical support.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Cancer health disparities research depends on access to biospecimens
   from diverse racial/ethnic populations. This multimethodological study,
   using mixed methods for quantitative and qualitative analysis of survey
   results, assessed barriers, concerns, and practices for sharing
   biospecimens/data among researchers working with biospecimens from
   minority populations in a 5 state region of the United States (Arizona,
   Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas). The ultimate goals of this
   research were to understand data sharing barriers among biomedical
   researchers; guide strategies to increase participation in biospecimen
   research; and strengthen collaborative opportunities among researchers.
   Methods and Population
   Email invitations to anonymous participants (n = 605 individuals
   identified by the NIH RePORT database), resulted in 112 responses. The
   survey assessed demographics, specimen collection data, and attitudes
   about virtual biorepositories. Respondents were primarily principal
   investigators at PhD granting institutions (91.1\%) conducting basic
   (62.3\%) research; most were non-Hispanic White (63.4\%) and men
   (60.6\%). The low response rate limited the statistical power of the
   analyses, further the number of respondents for each survey question was
   variable.
   Results
   Findings from this study identified barriers to biospecimen research,
   including lack of access to sufficient biospecimens, and limited
   availability of diverse tissue samples. Many of these barriers can be
   attributed to poor annotation of biospecimens, and researchers'
   unwillingness to share existing collections. Addressing these barriers
   to accessing biospecimens is essential to combating cancer in general
   and cancer health disparities in particular. This study confirmed
   researchers' willingness to participate in a virtual biorepository (n =
   50 respondents agreed). However, researchers in this region listed clear
   specifications for establishing and using such a biorepository:
   specifications related to standardized procedures, funding, and
   protections of human subjects and intellectual property. The results
   help guide strategies to increase data sharing behaviors and to increase
   participation of researchers with multiethnic biospecimen collections in
   collaborative research endeavors
   Conclusions
   Data sharing by researchers is essential to leveraging knowledge and
   resources needed for the advancement of research on cancer health
   disparities. Although U.S. funding entities have guidelines for data and
   resource sharing, future efforts should address researcher preferences
   in order to promote collaboration to address cancer health disparities.}},

Abstract = {{The incorporation of data sharing into the research lifecycle is an
   important part of modern scholarly debate. In this study, the DataONE
   Usability and Assessment working group addresses two primary goals: To
   examine the current state of data sharing and reuse perceptions and
   practices among research scientists as they compare to the 2009/2010
   baseline study, and to examine differences in practices and perceptions
   across age groups, geographic regions, and subject disciplines. We
   distributed surveys to a multinational sample of scientific researchers
   at two different time periods (October 2009 to July 2010 and October
   2013 to March 2014) to observe current states of data sharing and to see
   what, if any, changes have occurred in the past 3-4 years. We also
   looked at differences across age, geographic, and discipline-based
   groups as they currently exist in the 2013/2014 survey. Results point to
   increased acceptance of and willingness to engage in data sharing, as
   well as an increase in actual data sharing behaviors. However, there is
   also increased perceived risk associated with data sharing, and specific
   barriers to data sharing persist. There are also differences across age
   groups, with younger respondents feeling more favorably toward data
   sharing and reuse, yet making less of their data available than older
   respondents. Geographic differences exist as well, which can in part be
   understood in terms of collectivist and individualist cultural
   differences. An examination of subject disciplines shows that the
   constraints and enablers of data sharing and reuse manifest differently
   across disciplines. Implications of these findings include the continued
   need to build infrastructure that promotes data sharing while
   recognizing the needs of different research communities. Moving into the
   future, organizations such as DataONE will continue to assess, monitor,
   educate, and provide the infrastructure necessary to support such
   complex grand science challenges.}},

   and Scientific Research Staff}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Significant efforts are underway within the biomedical research
   community to encourage sharing and reuse of research data in order to
   enhance research reproducibility and enable scientific discovery. While
   some technological challenges do exist, many of the barriers to sharing
   and reuse are social in nature, arising from researchers' concerns about
   and attitudes toward sharing their data. In addition, clinical and basic
   science researchers face their own unique sets of challenges to sharing
   data within their communities. This study investigates these differences
   in experiences with and perceptions about sharing data, as well as
   barriers to sharing among clinical and basic science researchers.
   Methods
   Clinical and basic science researchers in the Intramural Research
   Program at the National Institutes of Health were surveyed about their
   attitudes toward and experiences with sharing and reusing research data.
   Of 190 respondents to the survey, the 135 respondents who identified
   themselves as clinical or basic science researchers were included in
   this analysis. Odds ratio and Fisher's exact tests were the primary
   methods to examine potential relationships between variables. Worst-case
   scenario sensitivity tests were conducted when necessary.
   Results and Discussion
   While most respondents considered data sharing and reuse important to
   their work, they generally rated their expertise as low. Sharing data
   directly with other researchers was common, but most respondents did not
   have experience with uploading data to a repository. A number of
   significant differences exist between the attitudes and practices of
   clinical and basic science researchers, including their motivations for
   sharing, their reasons for not sharing, and the amount of work required
   to prepare their data.
   Conclusions
   Even within the scope of biomedical research, addressing the unique
   concerns of diverse research communities is important to encouraging
   researchers to share and reuse data. Efforts at promoting data sharing
   and reuse should be aimed at solving not only technological problems,
   but also addressing researchers' concerns about sharing their data.
   Given the varied practices of individual researchers and research
   communities, standardizing data practices like data citation and
   repository upload could make sharing and reuse easier.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Learning disability (LD) is a serious and lifelong condition
   characterised by the impairment of cognitive and adaptive skills. Some
   cases of LD with unidentified causes may be linked to genetic factors.
   Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques are new approaches to
   genetic testing that are expected to increase diagnostic yield.
   Objectives: This scoping study focused on the diagnosis of LD in
   children and the objectives were to describe current pathways that
   involve the use of genetic testing; collect stakeholder views on the
   changes in service provision that would need to be put in place before
   NGS could be used in clinical practice; describe the new systems and
   safeguards that would need to be put in place before NGS could be used
   in clinical practice; and explore the cost-effectiveness of using NGS
   compared with conventional genetic testing.
   Methods: A research advisory group was established. This group provided
   ongoing support by e-mail and telephone through the lifetime of the
   study and also contributed face-to-face through a workshop. A detailed
   review of published studies and reports was undertaken. In addition,
   information was collected through 33 semistructured interviews with key
   stakeholders.
   Results: NGS techniques consist of targeted gene sequencing, whole-exome
   sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Targeted gene
   panels, which are the least complex, are in their infancy in clinical
   settings. Some interviewees thought that during the next 3-5 years
   targeted gene panels would be superseded by WES. If NGS technologies
   were to be fully introduced into clinical practice in the future a
   number of factors would need to be overcome. The main resource-related
   issues pertaining to service provision are the need for additional
   computing capacity, more bioinformaticians, more genetic counsellors and
   also genetics-related training for the public and a wide range of staff.
   It is also considered that, as the number of children undergoing genetic
   testing increases, there will be an increase in demand for information
   and support for families. The main issues relating to systems and
   safeguards are giving informed consent, sharing unanticipated findings,
   developing ethical and other frameworks, equity of access, data
   protection, data storage and data sharing. There is little published
   evidence on the cost-effectiveness of NGS technologies. The major
   barriers to determining cost-effectiveness are the uncertainty around
   diagnostic yield, the heterogeneity of diagnostic pathways and the lack
   of information on the impact of a diagnosis on health care, social care,
   educational support needs and the wider family. Furthermore, as NGS
   techniques are currently being used only in research, costs and benefits
   to the NHS are unclear.
   Conclusions: NGS technologies are at an early stage of development and
   it is too soon to say whether they can offer value for money to the NHS
   as part of the LD diagnostic process. Substantial organisational
   changes, as well as new systems and safeguards, would be required if NGS
   technologies were to be introduced into NHS clinical practice.
   Considerable further research is required to establish whether using NGS
   technologies to diagnose learning disabilities is clinically effective
   and cost-effective.}},

Abstract = {{One Health surveillance describes the systematic collection, validation,
   analysis, interpretation of data and dissemination of information
   collected on humans, animals and the environment to inform decisions for
   more effective, evidence- and system-based health interventions. During
   the second International Conference on Animal Health Surveillance
   (ICAHS) in Havana, Cuba, a panel discussion was organised to discuss the
   relevance of One Health in the context of surveillance. A number of
   success stories were presented which generally focused on the obvious
   interfaces between human and veterinary medicine such as zoonoses and
   food safety. Activities aimed at strengthening inter-sectoral networking
   through technical collaboration, conferences, workshops and
   consultations have resulted in recommendations to advance the One Health
   concept. There are also several One Health educational programmes
   offered as, Masters programmes. Continuing challenges to One Health
   surveillance were identified at both technical as well as organisational
   level. It was acknowledged that the public health sector and the
   environmental sector could be engaged more in One Health activities.
   Legal issues, hurdles to data sharing, unclear responsibilities and
   structural barriers between ministries prevent integrated action. Policy
   makers in the health sector often perceive One Health as a
   veterinary-driven initiative that is not particularly relevant to their
   priority problems. Whilst some funding schemes allow for the employment
   of scientists and technicians for research projects, the development of
   a sustainable One Health workforce has yet to be broadly demonstrated.
   Funding opportunities do not explicitly promote the development of One
   Health surveillance systems. In addition, organisational, legal and
   administrative barriers may prevent operational implementation.
   Strategies and communication across sectors need to be aligned. Whilst
   at the technical or local level the formal separation can be bridged,
   separate funding sources and budgets can jeopardise the overall
   strategy, especially if funding cuts are later required. To overcome
   such challenges, a strong business case for One Health surveillance is
   needed. This should include the costs and benefits of One Health
   activities or projects including consequences of different strategies as
   well as risks. Integrated training should also be further
   promoted.Future ICAHS conferences should continue to provide a platform
   for discussing surveillance in the One Health context and to provide a
   forum for surveillance professionals from all relevant sectors to

Abstract = {{Introduction To support control of sexually transmitted infections
   (STI), British Columbia is exploring data sharing through a provincial
   electronic health record (EHR). Increased electronic data sharing among
   healthcare providers may be a barrier for clients of STI clinics where
   expectations of privacy and confidentiality are heightened.
   Methods A survey to assess attitudes towards sharing of personal health
   information through a provincial EHR was conducted with a convenience
   sample of clients attending an STI clinic in Vancouver. Descriptive
   statistics and logistic regression were used to examine the association
   between the primary outcome variable, whether a client would be less
   likely to take the test for an STI or HIV if their clinic records were
   made part of a provincial EHR, and independent variables of interest.
   Results A total of 1004 clients completed the survey, and 31\% stated
   that they would be less likely to get tested for STI/HIV if their
   records were made part of a provincial EHR. Participants who were more
   likely to agree that they might avoid testing had the expectation that
   no other clinician would review their chart (adjusted OR (AOR)=3.55), or
   expected their records would not be shared beyond the clinic (AOR=2.81).
   Discussion While most participants thought an EHR was acceptable, a
   large minority expressed that they might avoid testing if their records
   were made part of a provincial EHR. The introduction of a provincial EHR
   should be considered with caution in STI healthcare settings to ensure
   that screening, case detection and treatment are not negatively
   impacted.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Knowledge of the biological pathways and mechanisms
   connecting social factors with health has increased exponentially over
   the past 25 years, yet in most clinical settings, screening and
   intervention around social determinants of health are not part of
   standard clinical care. Electronic medical records provide new
   opportunities for assessing and managing social needs in clinical
   settings, particularly those serving vulnerable populations.
   Purpose: To illustrate the feasibility of capturing information and
   promoting interventions related to social determinants of health in
   electronic medical records.
   Methods: Three case studies were examined in which electronic medical
   records have been used to collect data and address social determinants
   of health in clinical settings.
   Results: From these case studies, we identified multiple functions that
   electronic medical records can perform to facilitate the integration of
   social determinants of health into clinical systems, including
   screening, triaging, referring, tracking, and data sharing.
   Conclusions: If barriers related to incentives, training, and privacy
   can be overcome, electronic medical record systems can improve the
   integration of social determinants of health into health care delivery
   systems. More evidence is needed to evaluate the impact of such
   integration on health care outcomes before widespread adoption can be
   recommended. (C) 2015 American Journal of Preventive Medicine}},

Abstract = {{Clinical data exchange across organisational boundary is essential but
   not straightforward, since it involves a diverse range of systems that
   maintain not just incompatible data formats but also their autonomy.
   This is barrier of substantial significance not only to improved care
   for individuals whereas data sharing is essential to clinical decisions,
   but also administrative strategies and resource allocation for an entire
   population whereas datasets need to be aggregated. The Hubei Provincial
   Department of Health recently launched an initiative of a province-wide
   data exchange standard. Under investigation by the authors, the standard
   will guide vendors to implement a set of hierarchical platforms at
   various administrative levels, and connect clinical information systems
   to them and join the data exchange network. In this paper, we will
   describe the data exchange requirements in the province, the design of a
   service paradigm and specification of Clinical Document Architecture
   (CDA), as well as governing protocols towards the goal. A case study on
   patients with hypertension, from detection, diagnosis, referral,
   treatment, onwards to follow-up will be used for illustration. The work
   contributes a semantic and functional data exchange model, and will
   further support data analysis to both clinical and administrative
   decision-making in this province.}},

Abstract = {{A joint US-EU workshop on enhancing data sharing and exchange in

   problems related to public data availability, data quality, database
   interoperability (the ability to exchange information), standardization
   and sustainability. At the workshop, experts from universities and
   research institutes presented databases, studies, organizations and
   tools that attempt to deal with these problems. Furthermore, a case
   study showing that combining toxicogenomics data from multiple resources
   leads to more accurate predictions in risk assessment was presented. All
   participants agreed that there is a need for a web portal describing the
   diverse, heterogeneous data resources relevant for toxicogenomics
   research. Furthermore, there was agreement that linking more data
   resources would improve toxicogenomics data analysis. To outline a
   roadmap to enhance interoperability between data resources, the
   participants recommend collecting user stories from the toxicogenomics
   research community on barriers in data sharing and exchange currently

Title = {{A systematic review of barriers to data sharing in public health}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: In the current information age, the use of data has become
   essential for decision making in public health at the local, national,
   and global level. Despite a global commitment to the use and sharing of
   public health data, this can be challenging in reality. No systematic
   framework or global operational guidelines have been created for data
   sharing in public health. Barriers at different levels have limited data
   sharing but have only been anecdotally discussed or in the context of
   specific case studies. Incomplete systematic evidence on the scope and
   variety of these barriers has limited opportunities to maximize the
   value and use of public health data for science and policy.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of potential
   barriers to public health data sharing. Documents that described
   barriers to sharing of routinely collected public health data were
   eligible for inclusion and reviewed independently by a team of experts.
   We grouped identified barriers in a taxonomy for a focused international
   dialogue on solutions.
   Results: Twenty potential barriers were identified and classified in six
   categories: technical, motivational, economic, political, legal and
   ethical. The first three categories are deeply rooted in well-known
   challenges of health information systems for which structural solutions
   have yet to be found; the last three have solutions that lie in an
   international dialogue aimed at generating consensus on policies and
   instruments for data sharing.
   Conclusions: The simultaneous effect of multiple interacting barriers
   ranging from technical to intangible issues has greatly complicated
   advances in public health data sharing. A systematic framework of
   barriers to data sharing in public health will be essential to
   accelerate the use of valuable information for the global good.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine and characterize practices regarding data

   information systems (IISs), as well as barriers to using such data for
   research. Design: We surveyed immunization program managers (IPMs)
   associated with all 64 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
   grantee immunization programs (IPs) between July and September 2012.
   Results: More than 95\% of IPMs (61/64) responded. The top 2 barriers
   reported by IPMs to using IIS data for research were insufficient time
   and too few employees, irrespective of whether or not the jurisdiction
   reported using data for research purposes. Those IPMs who agreed with
   the statement ``Research is part of the mission of an immunization
   program{''} were more likely to report using data for research (P =
   .045). Among those who responded, the most common kind of IIS research
   conducted involved determinants of vaccination coverage (n = 24/26;
   92\%). A greater percentage of IPMs in jurisdictions that reported using
   IIS data for research reported having data-sharing agreements in place.
   Those IPs that have used IIS data for research were more likely to
   report online IIS provider enrollment, integration with insurance
   company records, and integration with hospital records. Alternatively,
   IPs that did not report using IIS data for research were more likely to
   have IISs with modules addressing topics such as adverse event
   reporting, smallpox, and first-responder vaccination. Conclusion: Staff
   size and time were the 2 most cited barriers to conducting research with
   IIS data. Therefore, focus should also be placed on providing IPs with
   the resources needed to conduct such research.}},

Abstract = {{The underlying ethos of dbGaP is that access to these data by secondary
   data analysts facilitates advancement of science. NIH has required that
   genome-wide association study data be deposited in the Database of
   Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) since 2003. In 2013, a proposed updated
   policy extended this requirement to next-generation sequencing data.
   However, recent literature and anecdotal reports suggest lingering
   logistical and ethical concerns about subject identifiability, informed
   consent, publication embargo enforcement, and difficulty in accessing
   dbGaP data. We surveyed the International Genetic Epidemiology Society
   (IGES) membership about their experiences. One hundred and seventy five
   (175) individuals completed the survey, a response rate of 27\%. Of
   respondents who received data from dbGaP (43\%), only 32\% perceived the
   application process as easy but most (75\%) received data within five
   months. Remaining challenges include difficulty in identifying an
   institutional signing official and an overlong application process. Only
   24\% of respondents had contributed data to dbGaP. Of these, 31\%
   reported local IRB restrictions on data release; an additional 15\% had
   to reconsent study participants before depositing data. The majority of
   respondents (56\%) disagreed that the publication embargo period was
   sufficient. In response, we recommend longer embargo periods and use of
   varied data-sharing models rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main barriers to the adoption of Personal Health Records
   (PHR) systems is their closed nature. It has been argued in the
   literature that this barrier can be overcome by introducing an open
   market of substitutable PHR apps. The requirements introduced by such an
   open market on the underlying platform have also been derived. In this
   paper, we argue that MyPHRMachines, a cloud-based PHR platform recently
   developed by the authors, satisfies these requirements better than its
   alternatives. The MyPHRMachines platform leverages Virtual Machines as
   flexible and secure execution sandboxes for health apps. MyPHRMachines
   does not prevent pushing hospital- or patient-generated data to one of
   its instances, nor does it prevent patients from sharing data with their
   trusted caregivers. External software developers have minimal barriers
   to contribute innovative apps to the platform, since apps are only
   required to avoid pushing patient data outside a MyPHRMachines cloud. We
   demonstrate the potential of MyPHRMachines by presenting two externally
   contributed apps. Both apps provide functionality going beyond the
   state-of-the-art in their application domain, while they did not require
   any specific MyPHRMachines platform extension. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Approximately 70\% of animal use is utilized to demonstrate quality
   control of vaccines. Especially rabies vaccine potency testing, using
   the NIH challenge test, involves objections in terms of scientific
   relevance, animal welfare concern and costs. Several 3R models have been
   proposed to refine, reduce or replace this test. Some are formally
   incorporated into regulatory requirements, but actual regulatory
   acceptance and use by industry lags behind, raising the question
   concerning which factors influence this process. This question is
   answered by a combination of literature review, interviews and a survey
   among 50 rabies vaccine experts. The findings are analyzed using the
   multilevel perspective on technology transition, which distinguishes 3
   levels of factors influencing innovation acceptance. At the micro level
   (where 3R models are developed and validated) the dis-advantages of, and
   fractional experience with, 3R models, scarce data sharing and demanding
   validation processes exist. The meso level (existing regulatory regime)
   encloses the barriers of the `gold standard', the lack of harmonization
   and the driving force of legislation stimulating 3Rs use. The macro
   level (the societal context) combines risk aversion and increased
   concern for animal welfare. Regulatory acceptance and use of 3R models
   requires dedicated stakeholder communication, cooperation and
   coordination at all three levels. (C) 2014 The International Alliance

   In New York City, we examined public health laws and agency policies for
   data sharing across HIV, sexually transmitted disease, tuberculosis, and
   viral hepatitis surveillance programs. We found that recent changes to
   state laws provide greater opportunities for data sharing but that
   agency policies must be updated because they limit increased data
   integration.
   Our case study can help other health departments conduct similar reviews
   of laws and policies to increase data sharing and integration of

Abstract = {{Data management and sharing are growing concerns for scientists and
   funding organizations throughout the world. Funding organizations are
   implementing requirements for data management plans, while scientists
   are establishing new infrastructures for data sharing. One of the
   difficulties is sharing data among a diverse set of research
   disciplines. Astrobiology is a unique community of researchers,
   containing over 110 different disciplines. The current study reports the
   results of a survey of data management practices among scientists
   involved in the astrobiology community and the NASA Astrobiology
   Institute (NAI) in particular. The survey was administered over a
   2-month period in the first half of 2013. Fifteen percent of the NAI
   community responded (n = 114), and additional (n = 80) responses were
   collected from members of an astrobiology Listserv. The results of the
   survey show that the astrobiology community shares many of the same
   concerns for data sharing as other groups. The benefits of data sharing
   are acknowledged by many respondents, but barriers to data sharing
   remain, including lack of acknowledgement, citation, time, and
   institutional rewards. Overcoming technical, institutional, and social
   barriers to data sharing will be a challenge into the future.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 21}},
Abstract = {{Data sharing is becoming increasingly common, but despite encouragement
   and facilitation by funding agencies, journals, and some research
   efforts, most neuroimaging data acquired today is still not shared due
   to political, financial, social, and technical barriers to sharing data
   that remain. In particular, technical solutions are few for researchers
   that are not a part of larger efforts with dedicated sharing
   infrastructures, and social barriers such as the time commitment
   required to share can keep data from becoming publicly available. We
   present a system for sharing neuroimaging data, designed to be simple to
   use and to provide benefit to the data provider. The system consists of
   a server at the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility
   (INCF) and user tools for uploading data to the server. The primary
   design principle for the user tools is ease of use: the user identifies
   a directory containing Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine
   (DICOM) data, provides their INCF Portal authentication, and provides
   identifiers for the subject and imaging session. The user tool
   anonymizes the data and sends it to the server. The server then runs
   quality control routines on the data, and the data and the quality
   control reports are made public. The user retains control of the data
   and may change the sharing policy as they need. The result is that in a
   few minutes of the user's time, DICOM data can be anonymized and made
   publicly available, and an initial quality control assessment can be
   performed on the data.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{The ability to exchange samples and data is crucial for the rapidly
   growth of biobanking. However, sharing is based on the assumption that
   the donor has given consent to a given use of her or his simple.
   Biobanking stakeholders, therefore, must choose 1 of 3 options: obtain
   general consent enabling multiple future uses before taking a sample
   from the donor, try to obtain consent again before sharing a previously
   obtained sample, or look for a legally endorsed way to share a sample
   without the donor's consent. In this study, we present the results of 36
   semistructured qualitative interviews with Swiss biobanking stakeholders
   regarding these options and the role of ethics committees in the process
   of authorizing sharing. Our results show that despite a lack of legal or
   guideline-based barriers to general consent, some stakeholders and
   ethics committees have reservations about this method of consent. In
   most cases, however, a general consent form is already in use. Many
   interviewees describe processes involving the ethics committees as
   time-consuming and cumbersome and their requirements as too demanding
   for donors/patients. Greater awareness of donors' opinions and
   preferences and the content of guidelines and recommendations could
   therefore be helpful for a better justified perspective of biobanking
   stakeholders and ethical committee members, equally. Finally, it may be
   necessary to differentiate between procedures governing future samples,
   where general consent is clearly desirable, and the use of old yet still
   relevant samples, where the option of using them without consent can be
   highly beneficial for research. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective To review the literature on the views of healthcare
   professionals to the linkage of healthcare data and to identify any
   potential barriers and/or facilitators to participation in a data
   linkage system.
   Methods Published papers describing the views of healthcare
   professionals (HCPs) to data sharing and linkage were identified by
   searches of Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and PsychINFO. The searches
   were limited to papers published in the English language from 2001 to
   2011.
   Results A total of 2917 titles were screened. From these, 18 papers
   describing the views of HCPs about data linkage or data sharing of
   routinely collected healthcare data at an individual patient level were
   included. Views were generally positive, and potential benefits were
   reported. Facilitators included having trust in the system including
   data governance, reliability, and feedback. Some negative views,
   identified as barriers were also expressed including costs, data
   governance, technical issues, and privacy concerns. Effects on the
   physician-patient relationship, and workload were also identified as
   deterrent.
   Discussion From the published literature included in this review, the
   views of HCPs were in general positive towards data sharing for public
   health purposes. The identification of barriers to contributing to a
   data linkage system allows these to be addressed in a planned data
   linkage project for pharmacovigilance. The main barriers identified were
   concerns about costs, governance and interference with the
   prescriber-patient relationship. These would have to be addressed if
   healthcare professionals are to support a data linkage system to improve
   patient safety.}},

Abstract = {{Data-driven innovation has great potential for the development of
   innovative services that not only have economic value, but that help to
   address societal challenges. Many of these challenges can only be
   addressed by data sharing of public and privately owned data. These
   public-private data sharing collaborations require data governance
   rules. Data governance can address many barriers, for example by
   deploying a decision model to guide choices regarding data sharing
   resulting in interventions supported by a data sharing platform. Based
   on a literature review of data governance and three use cases for data
   sharing in the logistics sector, we have developed a data sharing
   decision model from the perspective of a data provider. The decision
   model addresses technical as well as ownership, privacy, and economical
   barriers to sharing publicly and privately owned data and subsequently
   proposes interventions to address these barriers. We found that the
   decision model is useful for identifying and addressing data sharing
   barriers as it is applicable to amongst others privacy and commercial
   sensitive data.}},

Abstract = {{The constantly developing high content and high throughput screening
   (HCS \& HTS) microscopy and next generation sequencing technologies
   routinely produce experiment datasets in the terabyte (TB) or petabyte
   (PB) range resulting in millions of data files that can vary from simply
   numbers to signals and images. If the collaborators working on the same
   project are spread over large geographical distances, data sharing,
   interactive visualization and collaborative annotation techniques become
   important determinants of the success of a research project. On the
   other hand, there are hundreds of bioinformatic and cheminformatic
   databases, billions of documents in available literature, and many image
   based biological repositories, which need to be referred simultaneously
   to make sense out of the acquired data. To draw the conclusions from
   such increasingly complex and large scale data sources, the scientific
   community must be provided with simple to use methods to retrieve,
   analyze, visualize, annotate, and crosslink these data sources on a
   common platform in an efficient manner. However, on the other hand,
   these modern biological experiments and the subsequent analyses are
   completed with use of an array of different software suites and
   automated tools. A constant feedback from the experimenter is needed to
   change experimental paradigms for the follow-up experiments. Such a
   software platform to address the HCS data in these aspects does not
   exist yet, to the best of our knowledge. We have developed a simple to
   use software package called ``AskMe{''} for users to publish their large
   scale biological experiment data on to the web by use of data mining and
   visualization concepts. With use of AskMe, scientists can share these
   HCS datasets easily with their collaborators or made publicly accessible
   to the whole scientific community. From the initial stages of
   experiments, AskMe can ease the experimental analysis process by mining
   data and providing useful visualizations. Moreover, integration and
   crosslinks to other databases also allow easy evaluation of data
   generated. By these principles, we bring the tools to the data and make
   the data access transparent to the users without any capacity tradeoff.}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Over a decade ago, the fMRI Data Center (fMRIDC) pioneered open-access
   data sharing in the task-based functional neuroimaging community. Well
   ahead of its time, the fMRIDC effort encountered logistical,
   sociocultural and funding barriers that impeded the field-wise
   instantiation of open-access data sharing. In 2009, ambitions for
   open-access data sharing were revived in the resting state functional
   MRI community in the form of two grassroots initiatives: the 1000
   Functional Connectomes Project (FCP) and its successor, the
   International Neuroimaging Datasharing Initiative (INDI). Beyond
   providing open access to thousands of clinical and non-clinical imaging
   datasets, the FCP and INDI have demonstrated the feasibility of
   large-scale data aggregation for hypothesis generation and testing. Yet,
   the success of the FCP and INDI should not be confused with widespread
   embracement of open-access data sharing. Reminiscent of the challenges
   faced by fMRIDC, key controversies persist and include participant
   privacy, the role of informatics, and the logistical and cultural
   challenges of establishing an open science ethos. We discuss the FCP and
   INDI in the context of these challenges, highlighting the promise of
   current initiatives and suggesting solutions for possible pitfalls. (C)

Abstract = {{Water quality monitoring involves a complex set of steps and a variety
   of approaches. Its goals include understanding of aquatic habitats,
   informing management and facilitating decision making, and educating
   citizens. Environmental nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs) are
   increasingly engaged in water quality monitoring and act as
   environmental watchdogs and stewards of water resources. These
   organizations exhibit different monitoring mandates. As government
   involvement in water quality monitoring continues to decline, it becomes
   essential that we understand their modi operandi. By doing so, we can
   enhance efficacy and encourage data sharing and communication. This
   research examined Canadian ENGOs that collect their own data on water
   quality with respect to water quality monitoring activities and
   information needs. This work had a twofold purpose: (1) to enhance
   knowledge about the Canadian ENGOs operating in the realm of water
   quality monitoring and (2) to guide and inform development of web-based
   geographic information systems (GIS) to support water quality
   monitoring, particularly using benthic macroinvertebrate protocols. A
   structured telephone survey was administered across 10 Canadian
   provinces to 21 ENGOs that undertake water quality monitoring. This
   generated information about barriers and challenges of data sharing,
   commonly collected metrics, human resources, and perceptions of
   volunteer-collected data. Results are presented on an aggregate level
   and among different groups of respondents. Use of geomatics technology
   was not consistent among respondents, and we found no noteworthy
   differences between organizations that did and did not use GIS tools.
   About one third of respondents did not employ computerized systems
   (including databases and spreadsheets) to support data management,
   analysis, and sharing. Despite their advantage as a holistic water
   quality indicator, benthic macroinvertebrates (BMIs) were not widely
   employed in stream monitoring. Although BMIs are particularly suitable
   for the purpose of citizen education, few organizations collected this
   metric, despite having public education and awareness as part of their
   mandate.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for researchers to share their data has increased
   dramatically in recent years. There is a need to replicate and confirm
   scientific findings to bolster confidence in many research areas. Data
   sharing also serves the critical function of allowing synthesis of
   findings across trials. As innovative statistical methods have helped
   resolve barriers to synthesis analyses, data sharing and synthesis can
   help answer research questions that cannot be answered by individual
   trials alone. However, the sharing of data among researchers remains
   challenging and infrequent. This article aims to (a) increase support
   for data sharing and synthesis collaborations among researchers to
   advance scientific knowledge and (b) provide a model for establishing
   these collaborations using the example of the ongoing National Institute
   of Mental Health's Collaborative Data Synthesis on Adolescent Depression
   Trials. This study brings together datasets from existing prevention and
   treatment trials in adolescent depression, as well as researchers and
   stakeholders, to answer questions about for whom interventions work and
   by what pathways interventions have their effects. This is critical to
   improving interventions, including increasing knowledge about
   intervention efficacy among minority populations, or what we call
   scientific equity. The collaborative model described is relevant to
   fields with research questions that can only be addressed by

Abstract = {{Data sharing is essential for a better understanding of genetic
   disorders. Good phenotype coding plays a key role in this process.
   Unfortunately, the two most widely used coding systems in medicine,
   ICD-10 and SNOMED-CT, lack information necessary for the detailed
   classification and annotation of rare and genetic disorders. This
   prevents the optimal registration of such patients in databases and thus
   data-sharing efforts. To improve care and to facilitate research for
   patients with metabolic disorders, we developed a new coding system for
   metabolic diseases with a dedicated group of clinical specialists. Next,
   we compared the resulting codes with those in ICD and SNOMED-CT. No
   matches were found in 76\% of cases in ICD-10 and in 54\% in SNOMED-CT.
   We conclude that there are sizable gaps in the SNOMED-CT and ICD coding
   systems for metabolic disorders. There may be similar gaps for other
   classes of rare and genetic disorders. We have demonstrated that expert
   groups can help in addressing such coding issues. Our coding system has
   been made available to the ICD and SNOMED-CT organizations as well as to
   the Orphanet and HPO organizations for further public application and
   updates will be published online (www.ddrmd.nl and www.cineas.org).}},

   performance, the present research develops an integrative model that
   explores the determinants of green innovation with a focus being placed
   on knowledge sharing. Data were collected from 203 green innovation
   project leaders from electronics manufacturers operating in China. The
   results indicate that knowledge sharing mediates the relationship
   between green requirements and new green product success as well as that
   between green requirements and green product and process innovations.
   Interestingly, the empirical analysis rejects the hypothesized positive
   influence of green requirements on green product and process innovations
   as well as that on new green product success, while confirming that
   there exists a direct and positive association between green
   requirements and knowledge sharing. The direct positive impact of
   knowledge sharing is the strongest on green process innovation. This
   study provides a theoretical basis for investigating the possible
   determinants in the causal links between green requirements and green
   innovation success and establishes that knowledge sharing and green
   process innovation may be the points where leverage can be applied to
   best secure innovation success. Implications of the findings on
   environmental policy and law design are also discussed to see how the
   regulatory role of the government can be better positioned to facilitate
   compliance and innovation. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd

Abstract = {{Open access to research data is increasingly being institutionalized
   across funding and research-related organizations through data sharing
   policies. Compliance with these policies has been hampered by
   reluctance, amongst many social and natural scientists, to release data
   on an open access basis. Dominant approaches to tackling data sharing
   obstacles focus on methodological, ethical, legal, scientific and
   technological infrastructures. This article explores barriers to data
   sharing through examination of the changing conditions and practices of
   data sharing; specifically, the recent introduction of digital data
   sharing policies and their institutionalization of open access as a
   normative data sharing model. The scientific, moral and political
   assumptions underpinning open access digital data sharing policies and
   principles are examined, and their implications considered for data
   sharing practices. The paper suggests that data sharing obstacles may be
   understood in terms of a policy-practice divide, whereby data sharing
   policies fail to recognize data sharing as a relational practice. In
   conclusion, alternative relational approaches to data sharing policies
   are proposed, drawing on the Mass Observation Archive guidelines as a
   useful illustrative model.}},

Abstract = {{As data collections become established in key disciplines, some of the
   longstanding barriers to data sharing become to dissolve; yet others
   remain. While metadata and ontologies help overcome the problems of
   finding and interpreting data, the lack of clarity over licensing
   remains a real impediment to data reuse. Freedom from legal restriction
   and uncertainty is essential for the effective sharing, combining and
   deriving of data from these distributed collections. Reuse and
   recombination of data will be greatly facilitated by expanding the
   definition of the semantic web to include the semantics of data
   licensing. We aim to express licensing terms in a computable manner,
   within the context of research practice, enabling us to infer the
   resulting state of rights, obligations and conditions that are inherited
   by derived and recombined datasets, using a mixed bag of licenses.
   Building off this we aim to simulate the effects of varying licensing
   practices within communities, proposing a measure of health of our
   scholarly record based on compatibility and restrictiveness of the
   licenses contained therein.}},

Abstract = {{Information and communication technologies (ICT) play an essential role
   in supporting daily life in today's digital society. They are used
   everywhere and play an important role also in delivery of better and
   efficient healthcare services. The health care is currently not only in
   Czech Republic one of the biggest ``challenges{''} for advanced
   information and communication technology. Some of the main problems
   (ineffective use of some kinds of technological equipment, useless
   frequency of diagnostic tests, prescription of drugs often without
   knowledge of other drugs used by the same patient, several times visits
   of some patients to verify diagnosis) can be solved by sharing data and
   integrated information. The goal of this article is to find the main
   barriers of successful ICT deployment in hospitals in Czech Republic.
   The qualitative research of Information systems management and
   technologies was realized in three hospitals. This research was realized
   during one year (2012) by the structure questionnaire and interviews
   with IT managers, human resource officers, research and design (R\&D)
   managers and other management staff. The results confirm increasing use
   of Information and communication technology In health care sector
   especially in infrastructure, security and in education of staff. This
   is related to increasing requirement of financial resources and it is
   the biggest problem in all Czech hospitals. These increasing financial
   needs are in the conflict with political opinion and with the effort to
   keep health care free of charge especially in election years. Article
   also brings results of the secondary research which was oriented towards
   use of process management systems in Czech hospitals. These software
   tools can help to solve the biggest problems with lack of financial
   funds and to manage the effective and efficient hospital processes and
   ICT services.}},

Abstract = {{The research community is working to create new capabilities to share
   data and to deal with issues of data quality, standards, and protection,
   and ethical and responsible use of shared data. These issues have been
   found to influence the willingness of researchers to publish data
   created during the course of their research. We use the results of a
   survey conducted by the working groups of the DataONE project to present
   a new-understanding of challenges to the development of global data
   collections and preservation by systematically examining the
   determinants of the researchers' likelihood to openly publish research
   data. This study found two key determinants affecting researchers'
   willingness to publish their data. First is data management in terms of
   data management skills and organization support. Second is the
   acknowledgement of the data set's originator in terms of appreciation
   and legal and policy requirements. This study also found that the impact
   of the significant determinants is contingent on the amount of data to
   be published. Finally, this study calls for further investigation to
   ascertain the relationship of data management and data quality, and
   systematic investigation on the roles and responsibility of government
   within these global data preservations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Objective Registries are a well-established mechanism for obtaining high
   quality, disease-specific data, but are often highly project-specific in
   their design, implementation, and policies for data use. In contrast to
   the conventional model of centralized data contribution, warehousing,
   and control, we design a self-scaling registry technology for
   collaborative data sharing, based upon the widely adopted Integrating
   Biology \& the Bedside (i2b2) data warehousing framework and the Shared
   Health Research Information Network (SHRINE) peer-to-peer networking
   software.
   Materials and methods Focusing our design around creation of a scalable
   solution for collaboration within multi-site disease registries, we
   leverage the i2b2 and SHRINE open source software to create a modular,
   ontology-based, federated infrastructure that provides research
   investigators full ownership and access to their contributed data while
   supporting permissioned yet robust data sharing. We accomplish these
   objectives via web services supporting peer-group overlays, group-aware
   data aggregation, and administrative functions.
   Results The 56-site Childhood Arthritis \& Rheumatology Research
   Alliance (CARRA) Registry and 3-site Harvard Inflammatory Bowel Diseases
   Longitudinal Data Repository now utilize i2b2 self-scaling registry
   technology (i2b2-SSR). This platform, extensible to federation of
   multiple projects within and between research networks, encompasses
   >6000 subjects at sites throughout the USA.
   Discussion We utilize the i2b2-SSR platform to minimize technical
   barriers to collaboration while enabling fine-grained control over data
   sharing.
   Conclusions The implementation of i2b2-SSR for the multi-site,
   multi-stakeholder CARRA Registry has established a digital
   infrastructure for community-driven research data sharing in pediatric
   rheumatology in the USA. We envision i2b2-SSR as a scalable, reusable
   solution facilitating interdisciplinary research across diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity science and conservation increasingly depend on the sharing
   and integration of large amounts of data, but many researchers resist
   sharing their primary biodiversity data. We recently conducted an
   international survey to ascertain the attitudes, experiences, and

   to share article-related biodiversity data, more than 60\% of
   respondents are unwilling to share primary data before publishing.
   Results indicate an underdeveloped culture of data sharing and several
   major technological and operational barriers. A major concern for
   researchers is appropriate benefits from data sharing. Most respondents
   would accept data archiving policies of journals. Researchers also
   express concerns about how to easily and efficiently deal with data and
   data quality in public databases. Expectations for biodiversity
   databases include standardization of data format, user-friendly data

Abstract = {{Genetic and epidemiological research increasingly employs large

   quality human and model organism samples. Standardization efforts have
   produced a few simple formats for exchange of these various data, but a
   lightweight and convenient data representation scheme for all data
   modalities does not exist, hindering successful data integration, such
   as assignment of mouse models to orphan diseases and phenotypic
   clustering for pathways. We report a unified system to integrate and
   compare observation data across experimental projects, disease
   databases, and clinical biobanks. The core object model (Observ-OM)
   comprises only four basic concepts to represent any kind of observation:
   Targets, Features, Protocols (and their Applications), and Values. An
   easy-to-use file format (Observ-TAB) employs Excel to represent
   individual and aggregate data in straightforward spreadsheets. The

Abstract = {{Significant resources around the world have been invested in
   neuroimaging studies of brain function and disease. Easier access to
   this large body of work should have profound impact on research in
   cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry, leading to advances in the
   diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric and neurological disease. A trend
   toward increased sharing of neuroimaging data has emerged in recent
   years. Nevertheless, a number of barriers continue to impede momentum.
   Many researchers and institutions remain uncertain about how to share
   data or lack the tools and expertise to participate in data sharing. The
   use of electronic data capture (EDC) methods for neuroimaging greatly
   simplifies the task of data collection and has the potential to help
   standardize many aspects of data sharing. We review here the motivations
   for sharing neuroimaging data, the current data sharing landscape, and
   the sociological or technical barriers that still need to be addressed.
   The INCF Task Force on Neuroimaging Datasharing, in conjunction with
   several collaborative groups around the world, has started work on
   several tools to ease and eventually automate the practice of data
   sharing. It is hoped that such tools will allow researchers to easily
   share raw, processed, and derived neuroirnaging data, with appropriate
   metadata and provenance records, and will improve the reproducibility of
   neuroimaging studies. By providing seamless integration of data sharing
   and analysis tools within a commodity research environment, the Task
   Force seeks to identify and minimize barriers to data sharing in the

Abstract = {{There is growing recognition of the importance of data sharing in the
   neurosciences, and in particular in the field of neuroimaging research,
   in order to best make use of the volumes of human subject data that have
   been acquired to date. However, a number of barriers, both practical and
   cultural, continue to impede the widespread practice of data sharing;
   these include: lack of standard infrastructure and tools for data
   sharing, uncertainty about how to organize and prepare the data for
   sharing, and researchers' fears about unattributed data use or missed
   opportunities for publication. A further challenge is how the scientific
   community should best describe and/or reference shared data that is used
   in secondary analyses. Finally, issues of human research subject
   protections and the ethical use of such data are an ongoing source of
   concern for neuroimaging researchers. One crucial issue is how producers
   of shared data can and should be acknowledged and how this important
   component of science will benefit individuals in their academic careers.
   While we encourage the field to make use of these opportunities for data
   publishing, it is critical that standards for metadata, provenance, and
   other descriptors are used. This commentary outlines the efforts of the
   International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility Task Force on
   Neuroimaging Datasharing to coordinate and establish such standards, as
   well as potential ways forward to relieve the issues that researchers
   who produce these massive, reusable community resources face when making
   the data rapidly and freely available to the public. Both the technical
   and human aspects of data sharing must be addressed if we are to go

Title = {{Data Sharing by Scientists: Practices and Perceptions}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{JUN 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Scientific research in the 21st century is more data
   intensive and collaborative than in the past. It is important to study
   the data practices of researchers - data accessibility, discovery,
   re-use, preservation and, particularly, data sharing. Data sharing is a
   valuable part of the scientific method allowing for verification of
   results and extending research from prior results.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 1329 scientists participated
   in this survey exploring current data sharing practices and perceptions
   of the barriers and enablers of data sharing. Scientists do not make
   their data electronically available to others for various reasons,
   including insufficient time and lack of funding. Most respondents are
   satisfied with their current processes for the initial and short-term
   parts of the data or research lifecycle (collecting their research data;
   searching for, describing or cataloging, analyzing, and short-term
   storage of their data) but are not satisfied with long-term data
   preservation. Many organizations do not provide support to their
   researchers for data management both in the short- and long-term. If
   certain conditions are met (such as formal citation and sharing
   reprints) respondents agree they are willing to share their data. There
   are also significant differences and approaches in data management
   practices based on primary funding agency, subject discipline, age, work
   focus, and world region.
   Conclusions/Significance: Barriers to effective data sharing and
   preservation are deeply rooted in the practices and culture of the
   research process as well as the researchers themselves. New mandates for
   data management plans from NSF and other federal agencies and world-wide
   attention to the need to share and preserve data could lead to changes.
   Large scale programs, such as the NSF-sponsored DataNET (including
   projects like DataONE) will both bring attention and resources to the
   issue and make it easier for scientists to apply sound data management
   principles.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This practice brief report examines violence surveillance
   efforts among members of the Violence Prevention Advisory Group-a
   statewide advisory group of scientists and practitioners who inform
   violence prevention efforts throughout Colorado. Methods: We conducted
   qualitative interviews with members of the Violence Prevention Advisory
   Group (N = 19) to explore how violence-related surveillance data are
   used; we also examined barriers to collaboration. Interview data were
   analyzed using open coding and consensus building among authors.
   Results: Surveillance data were used to enable discussions about
   ``sensitive{''} topics, such as race and violence. The development of
   cross-sector policy recommendations and other types of shared work also
   emerged from collaborative data use. Proprietary issues such as data
   ``ownership{''} presented barriers to collaboration. Conclusion:
   Data-sharing protocols, education about laws, and cross-sector planning
   can improve collaborative data use, enabling more informed violence
   prevention efforts and potential improvements to the population's
   health.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In the United States, privacy standards under the federal
   Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) limit the sharing of
   individual student information between education and child welfare
   agencies. Although many entities identify foster youth as an
   educationally vulnerable population, this distinction does not exist
   within federal law. Foster youth are not delineated as an at-risk
   subgroup which limits the ability to exchange data in order to
   investigate education outcomes. While local jurisdictions may allow for
   the merging of student data, they vary with respect to information
   sharing and the interpretation of laws governing confidentiality.
   In California, additional data sharing challenges exist. California
   lacks a viable statewide education data system. Each school district
   collects its own student data and reports aggregate numbers to the
   state. Though a statewide child welfare data system, the California
   State Child Welfare Services/Case Management System (CWS/CMS) exists,
   youth identifiers are system specific, creating an obstacle to match
   children in this database to records from other institutions.
   Ultimately, coordination to address these challenges does not exist at
   the state level. Therefore, educators do not receive information that
   they need to appropriately respond to unique challenges associated with
   maltreatment and foster care placement.
   Current Paper: The current paper addresses multiple privacy and data
   challenges and lessons learned in a successful effort to link California
   education and child welfare administrative datasets. The California
   Department of Social Services (CDSS), the Center for Social Services
   Research at the University of California Berkeley (CSSR), the California
   Partnership for Achieving Student Success (Cal-PASS), and the Stuart
   Foundation initiated a collaborative partnership, called the Ready to
   Succeed Pilot Project, to link child welfare and education data. CSSR
   and Cal-PASS conducted the data merge with support from the other
   partners. CSSR receives quarterly extracts from the Child Welfare
   Services Case Management System (CWS/CMS). The Cal-PASS initiative
   collects, analyzes, and shares student data in order to track
   performance statewide.
   The California Ready to Succeed Pilot Project was able to overcome
   external legislative and legal constraints regarding data sharing. The
   team worked with various oversight agencies and committees in order to
   satisfy agency memorandums of understanding (MOU's) and Institutional
   Review Board (IRB) mandates. Many challenges to educational district
   support and agreement for project inclusion were mitigated. Lastly,
   using probabilistic matching, youth were linked in the two longitudinal
   data systems. Overall, the team was able to delineate a process that set
   a precedent for Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
   compliant data sharing between child welfare and education. The
   resulting dataset provided an opportunity to investigate aggregate
   education outcomes of foster youth in California with an emphasis on
   exploring the relationship between foster care placement and student
   performance.}},

Title = {{Correction: Using participatory design to develop (public) health
   decision support systems through GIS}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Organizations that collect substantial data for
   decision-making purposes are often characterized as being `data rich'
   but `information poor'. Maps and mapping tools can be very useful for
   research transfer in converting locally collected data into information.
   Challenges involved in incorporating GIS applications into the
   decision-making process within the non-profit (public) health sector
   include a lack of financial resources for software acquisition and
   training for non-specialists to use such tools. This on-going project
   has two primary phases. This paper critically reflects on Phase 1: the
   participatory design (PD) process of developing a collaborative
   web-based GIS tool.
   Methods: A case study design is being used whereby the case is defined
   as the data analyst and manager dyad (a two person team) in selected
   Ontario Early Year Centres (OEYCs). Multiple cases are used to support
   the reliability of findings. With nine producer/user pair participants,
   the goal in Phase 1 was to identify barriers to map production, and
   through the participatory design process, develop a web-based GIS tool
   suited for data analysts and their managers. This study has been guided
   by the Ottawa Model of Research Use (OMRU) conceptual framework.
   Results: Due to wide variations in OEYC structures, only some data
   analysts used mapping software and there was no consistency or
   standardization in the software being used. Consequently, very little
   sharing of maps and data occurred among data analysts. Using PD, this
   project developed a web-based mapping tool (EYEMAP) that was easy to
   use, protected proprietary data, and permit limited and controlled
   sharing between participants. By providing data analysts with training
   on its use, the project also ensured that data analysts would not break
   cartographic conventions (e. g. using a chloropleth map for count data).
   Interoperability was built into the web-based solution; that is, EYEMAP
   can read many different standard mapping file formats (e. g. ESRI,
   MapInfo, CSV).
   Discussion: Based on the evaluation of Phase 1, the PD process has
   served both as a facilitator and a barrier. In terms of successes, the
   PD process identified two key components that are important to users:
   increased data/map sharing functionality and interoperability. Some of
   the challenges affected developers and users; both individually and as a
   collective. From a development perspective, this project experienced
   difficulties in obtaining personnel skilled in web application
   development and GIS. For users, some data sharing barriers are beyond
   what a technological tool can address (e. g. third party data). Lastly,
   the PD process occurs in real time; both a strength and a limitation.
   Programmatic changes at the provincial level and staff turnover at the
   organizational level made it difficult to maintain buy-in as
   participants changed over time. The impacts of these successes and
   challenges will be evaluated more concretely at the end of Phase 2.
   Conclusion: PD approaches, by their very nature, encourage buy-in to the
   development process, better addresses user-needs, and creates a sense of
   user-investment and ownership.}},

Abstract = {{After the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004 the eyes of
   the world searched for the tools to reduce the risk of such hazards in
   the future. Initiated under the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation
   Program (NTHMP), the symbol of this effort has been the NOAA Deep-ocean
   and Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami (DART) station. With support
   from the President, over the next 18 months NOAA will expand deployment
   of the DART station network across the Pacific, Atlantic, Caribbean and
   Indian Oceans. But what more does this buoy represent? It represents
   operationalized science that will deliver data, change international
   policies, and forge new partnerships that serve multiple purposes. It
   has the promise of infusing research results into a 24-7 operational
   real-time warning system with fewer false alarms and set the stage for a
   tsunami forecast system that will help communities become more resilient
   to tsunami and related coastal hazards. This is of course a challenge
   with the high expectation that buoys must be part of a durable and
   sustainable network of observations, communications, and understanding.
   To deploy and maintain such a network is a test of technical, capacity,
   and fiscal commitment. To create and leverage partnerships and to
   harmonize the expertise of experts is required to achieve the desired
   benefits. But what else does it represent beyond budget constraints and
   personal challenges. It represents an opportunity for Government
   agencies to work with Academia and Industry to recognize a new focus on
   buoys to deliver the benefits of saving lives, property, economy and
   livelihoods across the globe. NOAA has protected and made available DART
   technology by working with all stakeholders, offering functional
   specifications and designing network capabilities. In recent weeks,
   commercial and industrial vendors have captured these lessons and begun
   delivering equipment and knowhow into the hands of individuals,
   organizations, and countries. NOAA considers this a success story but
   also only the beginning of what is the promise of the Integrated Ocean
   Observing System (IOOS) and the Global Earth Observing System of
   Systems. This somewhat simple buoy project within the Tsunami Program is
   a catalyst for real time information and knowledge, government-industry
   partnerships, and research to applications. In coming years we
   anticipate buoy stations becoming more multipurpose and multiuse,
   serving ecosystem, climate, weather, ocean, and commerce goals. At the
   same time, buoy-related IOOS and GEOSS projects will be vehicles for
   breaking down political and policy barriers by promoting data sharing
   and technology transfer. NOAA welcomes all buoy stakeholders to work
   with us and with new partners on research, operational, and commercial
   opportunities as we strive to deliver on the benefits of a truly global
   earth observing system of systems.}},

Abstract = {{Data grid is developed to facilitate sharing data and resources located

   benefits while selecting the best replica. In this paper, we propose a

   this strategy the replica selection problem is regarded as a
   classification problem. The data transfer history is utilized to help
   predicting the best site holding the replica. The adoption of the switch
   mechanism of replica selection model avoids a waste of time for
   inaccurate classification results. In this paper, we study and simulate
   KNN and SVM methods for different file access patterns and compare
   results with the traditional replica catalog model. The results show
   that our replica selection model outperforms the traditional one for
   certain file access requests.}},

Abstract = {{Recent national reports have highlighted the absence of a coordinated
   local, state, and national environmental health tracking system. Local
   environmental health agencies are struggling to design and implement
   data systems that will allow them to evaluate environmental exposures,
   ecological trends, and health outcomes in order to formulate more
   effective prevention strategies. This paper articulates the need for
   local environment and health tracking systems, discusses efforts under
   way around the nation, and describes the initiative being undertaken in
   one county health department to address this need. It provides
   information on attributes of indicators to be included in such a system,
   sources of data, criteria for evaluating the usefulness of indicators,
   suggestions for involving the community and staff, management strategies
   for implementing a data system, and recommendations for resolving common
   barriers to data sharing and use. This information will be useful to
   agencies that wish to develop their own robust environment and health
   tracking systems to support the three core functions of public health
   and the 10 essential public health services.}},

Abstract = {{Historically, ecologists have collected and stored data in
   individualistic ways, making data sharing among collaborators and
   subsequent data mining difficult. Integrating database technology into
   the research process makes data sharing across studies and access to
   analysis tools easier, but significant barriers to database use often
   prevent effective use of database technology. In this paper we identify
   some obstacles to use of information technology by ecologists, including
   the lack of systems for ecologists to design databases without hiring
   programmers. We describe a prototype system aka DataBank that aims to
   overcome these obstacles. The key system feature on which we focus is
   the reuse of domain-specific data types, which we call ``templates{''}.}},

Abstract = {{The pioneering discoveries in seismology over the last century have been
   made by those scientists fortunate to have access to key observations.
   In past eras, exchange of information has been limited by technology and
   sometimes by other restrictions on data sharing. This situation often
   created an artificial barrier between the ideas and curiosity of
   individual researchers and the data necessary to test those ideas.
   However, now we are seeing extensive databases of seismological data
   growing rapidly and becoming increasingly available via the Internet.
   Continued improvements in telecommunications technology are making
   global seismic data increasingly available in near-real time. These
   developments make possible a Virtual Seismic Network from which any
   seismologist with an Internet connection can access any data worldwide,
   in order to test a scientific idea. The guiding principles of such a
   system include: (i) Maintain open access to all recorded data; (ii)
   Maintain an open source software development philosophy; and (iii)
   Leverage advances in information technology and telecommunications to
   improve the reliability and speed of both data recovery and processing.
   One result of this improved research infrastructure will be the
   advancement of our understanding of the origin and evolution of the
   continental lithosphere.}},

Abstract = {{This article begins with a premise that intellectual property and
   privacy have something significant and yet understated in common: both
   are about balancing a creator's desire to control a particular set of
   data with consumers desires to access and redistribute that data. Both
   law and technology influence such balancing, making it more or less
   palatable to use data for particular purposes-whether one is an
   individual making a copy of a popular song for a friend, or a hospital
   selling a list of maternity ward patients to a day care service. In the
   shadow of the Intetnet's vapid development and concomitant easing of
   barriers to data sharing, holders of intellectual property are pairing
   increased legal protection with the technologies of ``trusted
   systems.{''} I describe how these technologies might allow more thorough
   mass distribution of data, while allowing publishers to retain
   unprecedented control over their wares. For instance, an e-Book seller
   might charge one price for a read-only copy that could not be printed or
   forwarded and charge an additional fee for each copy or printout made.
   Taking up the case of medical privacy, I then suggest that those who
   worry about the confidentiality of medical records, particularly as they
   are digitized by recent congressional mandate, might seek to augment
   comparatively paltry legal protections with trusted systems
   technologies. For instance, a trusted system could allow a patient to
   specify how and by whom her records could be used; within limits, she
   could allow full access to her primary care physician, while allowing
   only time-limited access to emergency care providers, non-personally
   identifiable access to medical researchers, and no access at all for
   marketing purposes. These technologies could allow for new kinds of
   privacy protection, without sacrificing the legitimate interests of the
   consumers of medical records.}},

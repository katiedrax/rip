  abstract = {This paper examines the contemporary issues of interoperability between the emerging telemedicine smart devices and classical, industrial telemedicine systems. The article also presents an overview of two health-related data exchange standards from the western hemisphere, and gives a review with requirement specification on telemedicine systems interoperability. The applied health data exchange standards have significant impact on the general and widely interpreted interoperability of Telemedicine Systems. Interoperability for Telemedicine Systems can bring unprecedented value both at personal and at community level. In the other hand, the ability of sharing medical data on a global basis significantly extends the potential means of worldwide epidemic control. International disease analysis and the resulting forecasting-capabilities supported by Telemedicine Systems Interoperability represents a significant milestone in the practical application of various ICT-solutions, like cloud architecture, telecommunication systems, smart-devices and smartphone apps. Legacy healthcare systems, smartphone apps, smart-devices and telemedicine instruments are sharing data continuously and some of them are interdependent on each other. However, there are still significant barriers blocking the flawless circulation of medical information among health-institutions and devices. This paper also intends to explore some barriers on telemedicine systems interoperability and presents recommendation for future enhancement on flawless telemedicine data exchange.},

Methodology: The approach used was quantitative with a quasi-experimental design. The method followed was the hypothetical-deductive one, since through the hypothesis test it was possible to determine the differences in the work groups. A total of 72 students participated, 35 in the control group and 37 in the experimental group. The gamification-based intervention lasted 7 weeks and included activities using different ICT resources. Results: There are significant statistical differences between the experimental group and the control group. Students who experimented through gamification, show better results. Conclusion: A correct pedagogical intervention mediated by ICTs and applying gamification, motivates students to improve their learning.},

It is covered by the objectives of sustainable development (goal 9) to support the research. The purpose of the study was to identify the habits and current experiences of Spanish researchers in the health sciences in relation to the management and sharing of raw research data. Method: An electronic questionnaire composed of 40 questions divided into three blocks was designed. The three Section s contained questions on the following aspects: (A) personal information; (B) creation and reuse of data; and (C) preservation of data. The questionnaire was sent by email to a list of universities in Spain to be distributed among their researchers and professors. A total of 1063 researchers completed the questionnaire. More than half of the respondents (54.9\%) lacked a data management plan; nearly a quarter had storage systems for the research group; 81.5\% used personal computers to store data; ``Contact with colleagues'' was the most frequent means used to locate and access other researchers' data; and nearly 60\% of researchers stated their data were available to the research group and collaborating colleagues. The main fears about sharing were legal questions (47.9\%), misuse or interpretation of data (42.7\%), and loss of authorship (28.7\%). The results allow us to understand the state of data sharing among Spanish researchers and can serve as a basis to identify the needs of researchers to share data, optimize existing infrastructure, and promote data sharing among those who do not practice it yet.},

Methods A literature review related to public health data sharing with local community partners was conducted using Medline, Embase, and CINAHL databases and grey literature sources with 12 articles included for analysis. Six LPHAs distributed an online survey to 405 local community organizations to define their current data uses and needs. Survey and literature review findings informed a one-day deliberative dialogue event with 19 participants who brought multiple perspectives together on the bathers and potential solutions for data sharing. Results Results are discussed utilizing the three stages of data sharing: awareness, communication, and collaboration. Awareness of the barriers and needs of community partners related to data, and the public health core competency of assessment and analysis is the first stage. More effective is the second stage, where LPHAs proactively communicate to understand and meet the needs of community partners. Data sharing is the most effective when LPHAs use the third stage of collaboration to work with community partners to mutually benefit from data sharing. Conclusion When LPHAs utilize their core competencies of assessment and analysis, communication, and collaboration to share data with community partners, they are able to share data more effectively. This allows community partners to modify programs to better serve priority populations and improve population health.},

Funding organizations are implementing requirements for data management plans, while scientists are establishing new infrastructures for data sharing. One of the difficulties is sharing data among a diverse set of research disciplines. Astrobiology is a unique community of researchers, containing over 110 different disciplines. The current study reports the results of a survey of data management practices among scientists involved in the astrobiology community and the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) in particular. The survey was administered over a 2-month period in the first half of 2013. Fifteen percent of the NAI community responded (n = 114), and additional (n = 80) responses were collected from members of an astrobiology Listserv. The results of the survey show that the astrobiology community shares many of the same concerns for data sharing as other groups. The benefits of data sharing are acknowledged by many respondents, but barriers to data sharing remain, including lack of acknowledgement, citation, time, and institutional rewards. Overcoming technical, institutional, and social barriers to data sharing will be a challenge into the future.},

Thus, efforts such as educational interventions among high-risk populations, especially the youth, are key to increasing public awareness regarding leptospirosis. This paper presents the findings of a pilot study wherein an educational intervention using a gamification intervention method was used to determine changes in leptospirosis knowledge among youth. On this note, students from a public university in Seremban district, Malaysia, were recruited and were asked to complete questionnaires before and after gamification activities. Baseline and immediate post-intervention data on leptospirosis knowledge were obtained. The total knowledge score was calculated, and differences in the mean pre- and post-intervention knowledge score were determined. Of the total 185 questionnaires that were completed at baseline and immediately post-intervention, only 168 that belonged to respondents who had heard of leptospirosis were analysed in this paper. A significant increase in leptospirosis knowledge was observed for the students following health education by gamification (p \textexclamdown{} 0.01). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of an educational intervention using gamification in improving leptospirosis knowledge among youth and suggest that gamification could become an efficient tool to prevent the disease within university-age demographics.},

  abstract = {Child maltreatment is a serious public health problem. Previous research demonstrates that child maltreatment clusters in low-income, racially homogenous neighborhoods. Little is known, however, about the structural correlates of spatial risk in small areas such as census tracts. Here we present additional information regarding the data and methods used in the recent article published in Child Abuse \& Neglect entitled ``Variability and stability in child maltreatment risk across time and space and its association with neighborhood social \& housing vulnerability in New Mexico: A Bayesian space-time model'' [1] . The present dataset merges child maltreatment data from the New Mexico Department of Public Health with multiple sources of publicly available data to create a novel public health analysis. Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling techniques were used to map the relative risk of substantiated child maltreatment across census tracts in the state, and to elucidate spatial and temporal heterogeneity in risk. The data was initially collected by the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department, the state organization that suspected child abuse and neglect cases are reported to and the organization that then substantiates these cases. The data were then sent to the New Mexico Community Data Collaborative, a data analytic organization under the umbrella of the New Mexico Department of Health. The point file consisting of home addresses of sub stantiated cases of child abuse was then aggregated by census tract, mapped for the entire state of New Mexico and made available to the public for research and analysis by different public health organizations and researchers (including the present researchers). The very purpose of making the data available to the public was to allow deeper investigations into trends and associations with other social determinants of health. This analysis demonstrates the public health importance of data sharing and accessibility. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.

Methods and Results: Using pairs of deep neural networks, we generated simulated, synthetic participants that closely resemble participants of the SPRINT trial (Systolic Blood Pressure Trial). We showed that such paired networks can be trained with differential privacy, a formal privacy framework that limits the likelihood that queries of the synthetic participants' data could identify a real a participant in the trial. Machine learning predictors built on the synthetic population generalize to the original data set. This finding suggests that the synthetic data can be shared with others, enabling them to perform hypothesis-generating analyses as though they had the original trial data. Conclusions: Deep neural networks that generate synthetic participants facilitate secondary analyses and reproducible investigation of clinical data sets by enhancing data sharing while preserving participant privacy.},

The findings confirm prior research of regional data-sharing difficulties, such as technological and database expertise and participation. Our study points to more fundamental limitations of regional data-sharing development for regional problem solving. Problems in many communities are simply local phenomena that may not be aided by a regional approach. Consequently, the development of a data system for regional problem solving ignores the specific nature of problems and the practical barriers inherent to accessing diverse databases. We agree that regional data sharing is important, but may be better tailored toward sharing data for short-term tactical purposes (e. g., pattern analysis) or for simply identifying problems, the first step in the problem-solving process, regionally.},

  abstract = {Objectives To determine the current situation and future directions of clinical trials and data sharing in radiology. Methods This survey was conducted between July and September 2018 among European heads of imaging departments and speakers at the Clinical Trials in Radiology sessions at ECR 2015-2018. The survey was approved by the ESR research committee, was administered online, and chi-square tests were used. Results The overall response rate was 29\% (132/460). Responses were received from institutions in 29 countries. These institutions reported having conducted 429 trials, leading to 332 publications, of which 43\% were first and 44\% were last authorships by those institutions. For future trials, 98\% of respondents (93/95) said they would be interested in sharing data, although only 34\% had shared data already (23/68, p \textexclamdown{} 0.001). The major barriers to data sharing were data protection (78\%, 74/95), ethical issues (49\%, 47/95), and the lack of a data sharing platform (49\%, 47/95). Of the respondents, 89\% believed a platform would facilitate data sharing (85/95 vs. 10/95 did not, p \textexclamdown{} 0.001) and should offer easy data uploading (74\%, 70/95), data safety (66\%, 63/95), easy communication between providers and re-users (62\%, 59/95), and data access policies (56\%, 53/95). Conclusion A considerable number of imaging trials are being performed and published by radiologists in Europe whilst data sharing is hardly taking place, despite great interest. This is most likely due to data protection and ethical issues, as well as the absence of a data sharing platform.},

We developed a novel data-sharing model to democratize health system data and to facilitate community and population health improvement. Methods Durham County, the City of Durham in North Carolina, Durham health systems and other stakeholders have developed a data-sharing model to inform local community health efforts. Aggregated health system data obtained through clinical encounters are shared publicly, providing data on the prevalence of health conditions of interest to the community. Results A community-owned web platform called the Durham Neighborhood Compass provides aggregate health data (e.g. on diabetes, heart disease, stroke and other conditions of interest) in the context of neighborhood social (e.g. income distribution, education level, demographics) and environmental (e.g. housing prices, crime rates, travel routes, school quality, grocery store proximity) contexts. Health data are aggregated annually to help community stakeholders track changes in health and health contexts over time. Conclusions The Durham Neighborhood Compass is among the first collaborative public efforts to democratize health system data in the context of social and environmental health determinants. This model could be adapted elsewhere to support local community and population health improvement initiatives.},

Indicators that estimate the extent and utility of such secondary use of research data need to reflect this complex and highly variable data usage. By linking open access scientific literature, via Europe PubMedCentral, to the metadata in biological data resources we separate data citations associated with a deposition statement from citations that capture the subsequent, long-term, reuse of data in academia and industry.~ We extend this analysis to begin to investigate citations of biomolecular resources in patent documents. We find citations in more than 8,000 patents from 2014, demonstrating substantial use and an important role for data resources in defining biological concepts in granted patents to both academic and industrial innovators. Combined together our results indicate that the citation patterns in biomedical literature and patents vary, not only due to citation practice but also according to the data resource cited. The results guard against the use of simple metrics such as citation counts and show that indicators of data use must not only take into account citations within the biomedical literature but also include reuse of data in industry and other parts of society by including patents and other scientific and technical documents such as guidelines, reports and grant applications.},

In developing the Shale Network, we have experienced reluctance to share data from all participating sectors. This paper explores this reluctance, identifying barriers to greater collaboration among multiple stakeholders in natural resource management projects. Findings are derived from participant observation of the Shale Network team, surveys conducted during Shale Network workshops, interviews with water quality stakeholders, and participant observation of water quality monitoring training sessions. The barriers identified include perceptions about data problems and quality, technical capacity, regulatory and legal limitations, competition for resources, and resource allocation decisions. This paper identifies strategies the Shale Network has used to overcome data-sharing barriers to expand a culture of data sharing that supports enhanced nature resource management and citizen engagement.},

  abstract = {There is growing recognition of the importance of data sharing in the neurosciences, and in particular in the field of neuroimaging research, in order to best make use of the volumes of human subject data that have been acquired to date. However, a number of barriers, both practical and cultural, continue to impede the widespread practice of data sharing; these include: lack of standard infrastructure and tools for data sharing, uncertainty about how to organize and prepare the data for sharing, and researchers' fears about unattributed data use or missed opportunities for publication. A further challenge is how the scientific community should best describe and/or reference shared data that is used in secondary analyses. Finally, issues of human research subject protections and the ethical use of such data are an ongoing source of concern for neuroimaging researchers. One crucial issue is how producers of shared data can and should be acknowledged and how this important component of science will benefit individuals in their academic careers. While we encourage the field to make use of these opportunities for data publishing, it is critical that standards for metadata, provenance, and other descriptors are used. This commentary outlines the efforts of the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility Task Force on Neuroimaging Datasharing to coordinate and establish such standards, as well as potential ways forward to relieve the issues that researchers who produce these massive, reusable community resources face when making the data rapidly and freely available to the public. Both the technical and human aspects of data sharing must be addressed if we are to go forward.},

  abstract = {Opioid use and misuse are continued issues facing clinicians across all aspects of health care. As clinicians struggle to effectively manage opioid prescribing, pharmacogenomics (PGx) further offers the prescriber an improved ability to understand the potential for an individual patient's genetics to influence opioid efficacy and safety. When PGx data are available at the point of initial prescribing, clinicians can apply that data to drug therapy selection. However, barriers continue to exist relative to PGx data sharing and interpretation, which have created difficulties for widespread PGx implementation. This article briefly describes potential barriers to PGx data integration, strategies to overcome those barriers, and the potential positive effect of successful data sharing on opioid prescribing. Prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) have been successfully operationalized to share controlled substance prescribing data across health care settings. Such data sharing enables clinicians to, among other things, better understand risks associated with misuse. Because a relatively limited volume of PGx data is currently pertinent to opioid prescribing, such PGx data could be added to PDMPs as a way to communicate genetic information within current technology platforms. Not only would this integrate into existing clinical workflow models where PDMP data are accessed at this point of prescribing and/or dispensing, but associated clinical guidance for PGx data interpretation in the context of opioids could be integrated into the workflow process. Such clinical decision support could be provided directly through the PDMP interface for uniformity or could be provided via systems that access PDMP data. Clinical, economic, and policy implications of the inclusion of PGx data within PDMPs are also discussed. Through harnessing PDMP for data sharing, multiple barriers to PGx implementation could be mitigated, and clinicians may have better access to PGx data to optimize opioid prescribing.},

Joining these records together at an individual level provides a complete picture of a patient's interaction with health services and allows better assessment of patient outcomes and effectiveness of treatment and services. Record linkage techniques provide an efficient and cost-effective method to bring individual records together as patient profiles. These linkage procedures bring their own challenges, especially relating to the protection of privacy. The development and implementation of record linkage systems that do not require the release of personal information can reduce the risks associated with record linkage and overcome legal barriers to data sharing. Current conceptual and experimental privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) models show promise in addressing data integration challenges. Enhancing and operationalizing PPRL protocols can help address the dilemma faced by some custodians between using data to improve quality of life and dealing with the ethical, legal, and administrative issues associated with protecting an individual's privacy. These methods can reduce the risk to privacy, as they do not require personally identifying information to be shared. PPRL methods can improve the delivery of record linkage services to the health and broader research community.},

Methods: A game show-based curriculum was developed from the basic principles of RID, which include the following: (1) distinguishing between clinical manifestations of STIs and management of long-term sequelae of STIs; (2) evaluation and management of common gynecologic infectious diseases, including chronic vaginitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and other pelvic infections; (3) diagnosis and management of perinatal infectious diseases, such as parvovirus, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, toxoplasmosis, and infection-mediated prematurity; (4) evaluation and management of obstetric and gynecologic postoperative infections; and (5) diagnosis and management of acute and chronic human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus infections in pregnancy. OBGYN residents at a large urban academic training program were randomized to either a Jeopardy-style educational game show intervention plus a traditional didactic-based curriculum or traditional didactic-based curriculum alone. The study team recruited participants by sending out an e-mail to all of the residents, detailing the study and consent process. Participants from both the intervention and control groups completed confidence and knowledge-based pretests. Posttests were administered 4 weeks after completion of the pretests. Statistical methods were applied to analyze the data. Results: Thirty-eight residents were randomized to a Jeopardy-style game show-based educational intervention (n = 19) or to a traditional didactic-based curriculum (n = 19). All of the participants (100\%) completed the pre- and posttests. Pretest median scores were similar between both groups, in which the Jeopardy group had a median score of 48.5 and the traditional group had a median score of 51.4 (P = 0.091). The Jeopardy group median test scores improved between the pretest and posttest (48.5 vs 62.8, P \textexclamdown = 0.001). The traditional didactic-based curriculum had a minimal increase in its median posttest scores (51.4 compared with 54.2, P = 0.773). The Jeopardy group had significantly higher posttest median scores and confidence scores than the traditional didactic-based curriculum (Jeopardy = 62.8, traditional = 54.2, P = 0.002). Conclusions: A game show-based curriculum improves OBGYN residents' confidence and retention of knowledge regarding RIDs, clinical manifestations and sequelae of STIs, and management of serious long-term consequences of STIs. Additional studies that include longer posttest time intervals are needed to assess the longer-term impact of game show-based curriculum on knowledge retention among OBGYN residents.},

How to effectively share valuable data therefore becomes a design focus of data lakes, which is a popular means of data sharing. Unfortunately, the privacy issues due to data sharing remains a missing piece in the data lake designs, which become a barrier of data sharing between foreign peers that might not completely trust each other. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for public data lakes to control and protect the data privacy of data sharing. The major objective of this work is to boost the circulation of valuable data for big data analytics, and promote the development of big data technologies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Research on data sharing from clinical trials has focused on elucidating perceptions, barriers, and attitudes among trialists and study participants with respect to sharing data. However, little information exists regarding utilization or associated publication of articles once clinical trial data have been widely shared. METHODS We analyzed administrative records of investigator requests for data access, linked publications, and bibliometrics to describe the use of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute data repository. RESULTS From January 2000 through May 2016, a total of 370 investigators requested data from 1 or more clinical trials. Requests for trial data have been increasing, with 195 investigators (53\%) initiating requests during the last 4.4 years of the study period. The predominant reason for requesting data was post hoc secondary analysis of new questions (72\%), followed by analytic or statistical approaches to clinical trials (9\%) and meta-analyses or pooled study research (7\%). Of 172 requests with online project descriptions, only 2 requests were initiated for reanalysis of primary-outcome findings. Data from 88 of 100 available clinical trials were requested at least once, and the median time from repository availability to first request was 235 days. A total of 277 articles were published on the basis of data from 47 trials. Citation metrics from 224 articles indicated that half of the publications have cumulative citations that rank in the top 34\% normalized for subject category and year of publication. CONCLUSIONS Demand for trial data for secondary analysis has been increasing. Requesting data for the a priori purpose of reanalysis or verification of original findings was rare.},

  abstract = {The ability to exchange samples and data is crucial for the rapidly growth of biobanking. However, sharing is based on the assumption that the donor has given consent to a given use of her or his simple. Biobanking stakeholders, therefore, must choose 1 of 3 options: obtain general consent enabling multiple future uses before taking a sample from the donor, try to obtain consent again before sharing a previously obtained sample, or look for a legally endorsed way to share a sample without the donor's consent. In this study, we present the results of 36 semistructured qualitative interviews with Swiss biobanking stakeholders regarding these options and the role of ethics committees in the process of authorizing sharing. Our results show that despite a lack of legal or guideline-based barriers to general consent, some stakeholders and ethics committees have reservations about this method of consent. In most cases, however, a general consent form is already in use. Many interviewees describe processes involving the ethics committees as time-consuming and cumbersome and their requirements as too demanding for donors/patients. Greater awareness of donors' opinions and preferences and the content of guidelines and recommendations could therefore be helpful for a better justified perspective of biobanking stakeholders and ethical committee members, equally. Finally, it may be necessary to differentiate between procedures governing future samples, where general consent is clearly desirable, and the use of old yet still relevant samples, where the option of using them without consent can be highly beneficial for research.

  abstract = {A requirement of data archives is that data holdings can be easily discovered, accessed, and used. One approach to improving data discovery and access is through data citations coupled with Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). The Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC) since 1998 has issued data citations that have been accepted and used in peer-reviewed journals. Citation elements established by the ORNL DAAC are similar to those used for journal articles (authors, year, product title, and information to locate), and beginning in 2007 included a DOI that is persistent, actionable, specific, and complete. The approach used at the ORNL DAAC also allows for referring to subsets of the data, by including within the citation the temporal and spatial extent, and parameters used. Data citations allow readers to find data and reproduce the results of the research article, and also use those data to test new hypotheses, design new sample collections, or construct or evaluate models. The ORNL DAAC uses a manual method to compile data citations and has developed a database that links research articles and their use of specific ORNL DAAC data products. Automation of the data citation compilation process, as is the case for articles, will enable data citations to become a more common practice. In addition to enhancing discovery and access of the data used in a research article, the citation gives credit to data generators, data centers and their funders, and, through citation indices, determine the scientific impact of a data set.

Design: We surveyed immunization program managers (IPMs) associated with all 64 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grantee immunization programs (IPs) between July and September 2012. Results: More than 95\% of IPMs (61/64) responded. The top 2 barriers reported by IPMs to using IIS data for research were insufficient time and too few employees, irrespective of whether or not the jurisdiction reported using data for research purposes. Those IPMs who agreed with the statement ``Research is part of the mission of an immunization program'' were more likely to report using data for research (P = .045). Among those who responded, the most common kind of IIS research conducted involved determinants of vaccination coverage (n = 24/26; 92\%). A greater percentage of IPMs in jurisdictions that reported using IIS data for research reported having data-sharing agreements in place. Those IPs that have used IIS data for research were more likely to report online IIS provider enrollment, integration with insurance company records, and integration with hospital records. Alternatively, IPs that did not report using IIS data for research were more likely to have IISs with modules addressing topics such as adverse event reporting, smallpox, and first-responder vaccination. Conclusion: Staff size and time were the 2 most cited barriers to conducting research with IIS data. Therefore, focus should also be placed on providing IPs with the resources needed to conduct such research.},

Methods: It is a qualitative and descriptive research, being a scoping review of literature, by searching the Emerald, LISA, LIST, Scopus and Web of Science databases. Results: The studies investigated the correlation of citations increment to traditional publications by citing the data that supported them, many studies confirmed the correlation, others did not, and a common cause hypothesis arose: research quality associated with more resources. As for practices, the community is aware that current citations to data are not standardized, and there is a tendency to adopt a citation standard that meets the demands of different types of data. This lack of standard hinders the metric analysis of citation to scientific data that still needs to be explored in research, given that there is a repetition in using the same techniques of traditional citation for this new source of information. Conclusions: Promoting the progress of science is the main advantage in making data available, but there are credit and technical difficulties that need to be tackled together by researchers, institutions, funding agencies, data repositories, and publishing editorial teams.},

While there are a few well-known case examples of data-driven CMER, in general it has been partially implemented. In this paper, we highlight the importance of historical institutional and spatial context and path dependencies in shaping the development of CMERs within and across jurisdictions. We examine the progress and prospects of data-driven CMER in Ireland, with respect to the general landscape of inter-agency cooperation and with reference to a single key agency: An Garda Siochana (AGS), the Irish police force. To do so, we draw on 36 in-depth interviews with key stakeholders and a critical discourse analysis of 15 key policy/guideline documents. Our analysis reveals the ways in which embedded institutional cultures, structures and working practices, which are relatively resistant to change, have thwarted data-sharing and data-driven analysis and decision-making. These factors act as barriers to the adoption of smart-city approaches more generally, not just in Ireland but globally.},

Specifically, the Canary Islands has the highest level of this disease in Europe and 40\% of children in Spain are overweight or obese. This increase is a direct result of changes in the lifestyles of the population and its nutrition. Because of this, we have designed an educational program based on motor games, active videogames and virtual learning environments to improve the long-term health of children. This article presents and analyzes the results of a study on the nutritional knowledge and adherence to the Mediterranean diet of 46 obese children aged 6 to 12 years in the Canary Islands who participated in an educational program. The study design was quasi-experimental, with two groups (experimental and control). A long-term longitudinal study (3 years) was carried out. A set of evaluation instruments was used for the different phases. The results show significant improvements between the experimental and control groups in terms of their knowledge of healthy nutrition and their adherence to the Mediterranean diet. As a main conclusion, we emphasize that a gamified educational intervention program supported by ICT helps to motivate and promote improvements in the nutrition of children.},

  abstract = {Background: Post-market surveillance of medical devices is reliant on physician reporting of adverse medical device events (AMDEs). Few studies have examined factors that influence whether and how physicians report AMDEs, an essential step in the development of behaviour change interventions. This study was a secondary analysis comparing application of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases (TICD) framework to identify potential behaviour change interventions that correspond to determinants of AMDE reporting. Methods: A previous study involving qualitative interviews with Canadian physicians that implant medical devices identified themes reflecting AMDE reporting determinants. In this secondary analysis, themes that emerged from the primary analysis were independently mapped to the TDF and TICD. Determinants and corresponding intervention options arising from both frameworks (and both mappers) were compared. Results: Both theoretical frameworks were useful for identifying interventions corresponding to behavioural determinants of AMDE reporting. Information or education strategies that provide evidence about AMDEs, and audit and feedback of AMDE data were identified as interventions to target the theme of physician beliefs; improving information systems, and reminder cues, prompts and awards were identified as interventions to address determinants arising from the organization or systems themes; and modifying financial/non-financial incentives and sharing data on outcomes associated with AMDEs were identified as interventions to target device market themes. Numerous operational challenges were encountered in the application of both frameworks including a lack of clarity about how directly relevant to themes the domains/determinants should be, how many domains/determinants to select, if and how to resolve discrepancies across multiple mappers, and how to choose interventions from among the large number associated with selected domains/determinants. Conclusions: Given discrepancies in mapping themes to determinants/domains and the resulting interventions offered by the two frameworks, uncertainty remains about how to choose interventions that best match behavioural determinants in a given context. Further research is needed to provide more nuanced guidance on the application of TDF and TICD for a broader audience, which is likely to increase the utility and uptake of these frameworks in practice.},

  abstract = {The peer-review process was designed to assure the validity and quality of science that seeks publication. As such, peer review is a cornerstone of science, confirming the ``worth'' of scientific studies and results. However, the peer-review process is increasingly seen as biased, opaque, slow and inconsistent. Its quality and efficiency depends on a complex, large-scale collaboration process, which is sensitive to motivations, incentives and institutional contexts. PEERE (New Frontiers of Peer Review), a recent EU-funded action, aims to improve efficiency, transparency and accountability of peer review through a trans-disciplinary, cross-sectorial collaboration. In this paper, we report on the results of one of PEERE's activities, in which we explore, in a simulated environment, different approaches to peer reviewing. The objectives of this Action are: (i) to analyse peer review in different scientific areas by integrating quantitative and qualitative research and incorporating recent experimental and computational findings, (ii) to evaluate the implications of different models of peer review and to explore new incentive structures, rules and measures to improve collaboration in all stages of the peer review process; (iii) to involve science stakeholders in data sharing and testing initiatives, and, (iv) to collaboratively define a joint research agenda that points to an evidence-based peer review reform. In order to understand the effect of different peer-review models on the behaviour of reviewers, an understanding of the context and culture of peer review is required. In this paper, we present a framework to analyse different peer-review formats, based on models of social aspects of human motivation. In order to analyse the effect of different peer-review models on the behaviour of reviewers, a deep understanding of the context and culture of peer review is required, which includes a rich model of agent's motives and behaviours. The theory of human motivation by McClelland distinguishes four motives (McClelland (1987)): Achievement: is about achieving goal states and drives people to try to achieve different things, thus, fostering explorative behaviour that satisfies the need for novelty. Power: is about trying to have an impact on the world, and includes both the need to control both its own and other's actions. Affiliation: drives people to seek the company of others and to establish and maintain positive interactions with others. Avoidance: leads to self preservation, seeking certainty, and emotional regulation, and fosters the categorization and simplification of behaviour so that it becomes more standardized (and thus predictable). Moreover, our simulation framework supports the specification of different peer-review practices. These practices are then compared by letting agents with different social frames enact the different reviewing approaches. The model considers motives and social practices as basis for deliberation. We show initial simulation results on two different peer-review processes.},

  abstract = {It is widely accepted that data is fundamental for research and should therefore be cited as textual scientific publications. However, issues like data citation, handling and counting the credit generated by such citations, remain open research questions. Data credit is a new measure of value built on top of data citation, which enables us to annotate data with a value, representing its importance. Data credit can be considered as a new tool that, together with traditional citations, helps to recognize the value of data and its creators in a world that is ever more depending on data. In this paper we define data credit distribution (DCD) as a process by which credit generated by citations is given to the single elements of a database. We focus on a scenario where a paper cites data from a database obtained by issuing a query. The citation generates credit which is then divided among the database entities responsible for generating the query output. One key aspect of our work is to credit not only the explicitly cited entities, but even those that contribute to their existence, but which are not accounted in the query output. We propose a data credit distribution strategy (CDS) based on data provenance and implement a system that uses the information provided by data citations to distribute the credit in a relational database accordingly. As use case and for evaluation purposes, we adopt the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (GtoPdb), a curated relational database. We show how credit can be used to highlight areas of the database that are frequently used. Moreover, we also underline how credit rewards data and authors based on their research impact, and not merely on the number of citations. This can lead to designing new bibliometrics for data citations. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Electronic Health Records (EHR) contain extensive information on various health outcomes and risk factors, and therefore have been broadly used in healthcare research. Integrating EHR data from multiple clinical sites can accelerate knowledge discovery and risk prediction by providing a larger sample size in a more general population which potentially reduces clinical bias and improves estimation and prediction accuracy. To overcome the barrier of patient-level data sharing, distributed algorithms are developed to conduct statistical analyses across multiple sites through sharing only aggregated information. The current distributed algorithm often requires iterative information evaluation and transferring across sites, which can potentially lead to a high communication cost in practical settings. In this study, we propose a privacy-preserving and communication-efficient distributed algorithm for logistic regression without requiring iterative communications across sites. Our simulation study showed our algorithm reached comparative accuracy comparing to the oracle estimator where data are pooled together. We applied our algorithm to an EHR data from the University of Pennsylvania health system to evaluate the risks of fetal loss due to various medication exposures.},

Many of these challenges can only be addressed by data sharing of public and privately owned data. These public-private data sharing collaborations require data governance rules. Data governance can address many barriers, for example by deploying a decision model to guide choices regarding data sharing resulting in interventions supported by a data sharing platform. Based on a literature review of data governance and three use cases for data sharing in the logistics sector, we have developed a data sharing decision model from the perspective of a data provider. The decision model addresses technical as well as ownership, privacy, and economical barriers to sharing publicly and privately owned data and subsequently proposes interventions to address these barriers. We found that the decision model is useful for identifying and addressing data sharing barriers as it is applicable to amongst others privacy and commercial sensitive data.},

  abstract = {Background Significant efforts are underway within the biomedical research community to encourage sharing and reuse of research data in order to enhance research reproducibility and enable scientific discovery. While some technological challenges do exist, many of the barriers to sharing and reuse are social in nature, arising from researchers' concerns about and attitudes toward sharing their data. In addition, clinical and basic science researchers face their own unique sets of challenges to sharing data within their communities. This study investigates these differences in experiences with and perceptions about sharing data, as well as barriers to sharing among clinical and basic science researchers. Methods Clinical and basic science researchers in the Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health were surveyed about their attitudes toward and experiences with sharing and reusing research data. Of 190 respondents to the survey, the 135 respondents who identified themselves as clinical or basic science researchers were included in this analysis. Odds ratio and Fisher's exact tests were the primary methods to examine potential relationships between variables. Worst-case scenario sensitivity tests were conducted when necessary. Results and Discussion While most respondents considered data sharing and reuse important to their work, they generally rated their expertise as low. Sharing data directly with other researchers was common, but most respondents did not have experience with uploading data to a repository. A number of significant differences exist between the attitudes and practices of clinical and basic science researchers, including their motivations for sharing, their reasons for not sharing, and the amount of work required to prepare their data. Conclusions Even within the scope of biomedical research, addressing the unique concerns of diverse research communities is important to encouraging researchers to share and reuse data. Efforts at promoting data sharing and reuse should be aimed at solving not only technological problems, but also addressing researchers' concerns about sharing their data. Given the varied practices of individual researchers and research communities, standardizing data practices like data citation and repository upload could make sharing and reuse easier.},

  abstract = {Background: In the United States, privacy standards under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) limit the sharing of individual student information between education and child welfare agencies. Although many entities identify foster youth as an educationally vulnerable population, this distinction does not exist within federal law. Foster youth are not delineated as an at-risk subgroup which limits the ability to exchange data in order to investigate education outcomes. While local jurisdictions may allow for the merging of student data, they vary with respect to information sharing and the interpretation of laws governing confidentiality. In California, additional data sharing challenges exist. California lacks a viable statewide education data system. Each school district collects its own student data and reports aggregate numbers to the state. Though a statewide child welfare data system, the California State Child Welfare Services/Case Management System (CWS/CMS) exists, youth identifiers are system specific, creating an obstacle to match children in this database to records from other institutions. Ultimately, coordination to address these challenges does not exist at the state level. Therefore, educators do not receive information that they need to appropriately respond to unique challenges associated with maltreatment and foster care placement. Current Paper: The current paper addresses multiple privacy and data challenges and lessons learned in a successful effort to link California education and child welfare administrative datasets. The California Department of Social Services (CDSS), the Center for Social Services Research at the University of California Berkeley (CSSR), the California Partnership for Achieving Student Success (Cal-PASS), and the Stuart Foundation initiated a collaborative partnership, called the Ready to Succeed Pilot Project, to link child welfare and education data. CSSR and Cal-PASS conducted the data merge with support from the other partners. CSSR receives quarterly extracts from the Child Welfare Services Case Management System (CWS/CMS). The Cal-PASS initiative collects, analyzes, and shares student data in order to track performance statewide. The California Ready to Succeed Pilot Project was able to overcome external legislative and legal constraints regarding data sharing. The team worked with various oversight agencies and committees in order to satisfy agency memorandums of understanding (MOU's) and Institutional Review Board (IRB) mandates. Many challenges to educational district support and agreement for project inclusion were mitigated. Lastly, using probabilistic matching, youth were linked in the two longitudinal data systems. Overall, the team was able to delineate a process that set a precedent for Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) compliant data sharing between child welfare and education. The resulting dataset provided an opportunity to investigate aggregate education outcomes of foster youth in California with an emphasis on exploring the relationship between foster care placement and student performance.},

In this fourth article in a series on district decision-making for health, we assessed the extent of maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH)-related data sharing between the private and public sectors in two districts of Uttar Pradesh, India; analysed barriers to data sharing; and identified key inputs required for data sharing. Between March 2013 and August 2014, we conducted 74 key informant interviews at national, state and district levels. Respondents were stakeholders from national, state and district health departments, professional associations, non-governmental programmes and private commercial health facilities with 3-200 beds. Qualitative data were analysed using a framework based on a priori and emerging themes. Private facilities registered for ultrasounds and abortions submitted standardized records on these services, which is compulsory under Indian laws. Data sharing for other services was weak, but most facilities maintained basic records related to institutional deliveries and newborns. Public health facilities in blocks collected these data from a few private facilities using different methods. The major barriers to data sharing included the public sector's non-standardized data collection and utilization systems for MNCH and lack of communication and follow up with private facilities. Private facilities feared information disclosure and the additional burden of reporting, but were willing to share data if asked officially, provided the process was simple and they were assured of confidentiality. Unregistered facilities, managed by providers without a biomedical qualification, also conducted institutional deliveries, but were outside any reporting loops. Our findings suggest that even without legislation, the public sector could set up an effective MNCH data sharing strategy with private registered facilities by developing a standardized and simple system with consistent communication and follow up.},

  abstract = {Language documentation and description are closely related practices, often performed as part of the same fieldwork project on an un(der)-studied language. Research trends in recent decades have seen a great volume of publishing in regards to the methods of language documentation, however, it is not clear that linguists' awareness of the importance of robust data-collection methods is translating into transparency about those methods or data citation in resultant publications. We analyze 50 dissertations and 50 grammars from a ten-year span (2003-2012) to assess the current state of the field. Publications are critiqued on the basis of transparency of data collection methods, analysis and storage, as well as citation of primary data. While we found examples of transparent reporting in these areas, much of the surveyed research does not include key information about methodology or data. We acknowledge that descriptive linguists often practice good methodology in data collection, but as a field we need to build a better culture with regard to making this clear in research writing. Thus we conclude with suggested benchmarks for the kind of information we believe is vital for creating a rich and useful research methodology in both long and short format descriptive research writing.},

Due to the absence of appropriate space for the sharing of and access to geospatial assets, these often remain scattered and locked within various economic sectors of Ethiopia; this means that datasets are not maintained or updated regularly, efforts are duplicated, finding available datasets is difficult and there is no single reliable version of the data. Exploitation of the full socioeconomic benefits of using geospatial information is therefore impossible. This paper therefore aims to assess inter-organisational geospatial data-sharing challenges and the possible solutions within Ethiopia. A lack of coordination between organisations, poor data quality and compatibility, institutional, legal, policy, and technological issues are identified as major challenges. Ethiopian National Spatial Data Infrastructure (ENSDI), which has already been introduced, should be further promoted as the collaborative entity for effective cross-sectoral geospatial data sharing. A national strategy to hand over informal SDI initiatives, building on existing efforts, setting clear (top-down) ENSDI development approaches and collaborative investments in the building blocks of ENSDI are suggested to enable the successful execution of ENSDI as a cross-sectoral geospatial data-sharing mechanism.},

  abstract = {Introduction The digitalization of medicine has led to a considerable growth of heterogeneous health datasets, which could improve healthcare research if integrated into the clinical life cycle. This process requires, amongst other things, the harmonization of these datasets, which is a prerequisite to improve their quality, re-usability and interoperability. However, there is a wide range of factors that either hinder or favor the harmonized collection, sharing and linkage of health data. Objective This systematic review aims to identify barriers and facilitators to health data harmonization-including data sharing and linkage-by a comparative analysis of studies from Denmark and Switzerland. Methods Publications from PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and CINAHL involving cross-institutional or cross-border collection, sharing or linkage of health data from Denmark or Switzerland were searched to identify the reported barriers and facilitators to data harmonization. Results Of the 345 projects included, 240 were single-country and 105 were multinational studies. Regarding national projects, a Swiss study reported on average more barriers and facilitators than a Danish study. Barriers and facilitators of a technical nature were most frequently reported. Conclusion This systematic review gathered evidence from Denmark and Switzerland on barriers and facilitators concerning data harmonization, sharing and linkage. Barriers and facilitators were strictly interrelated with the national context where projects were carried out. Structural changes, such as legislation implemented at the national level, were mirrored in the projects. This underlines the impact of national strategies in the field of health data. Our findings also suggest that more openness and clarity in the reporting of both barriers and facilitators to data harmonization constitute a key element to promote the successful management of new projects using health data and the implementation of proper policies in this field. Our study findings are thus meaningful beyond these two countries.},

It is a bottom-up organisation which after two and a half years of existence gathers around 3,000 members from 100 different countries. Work in RDA is organised in a bottom-up way, through Working Groups and Interest Groups proposed by the community. These groups can deal with any aspect of research data sharing, which means a huge diversity in the activities. Some scientific communities use the RDA as a neutral place to hold the discussions about their disciplinary interoperability framework. Astronomy has the IVOA and the FITS Committee for that purpose, and the ADASS Colloquia to deal with astronomical data systems. But many RDA topics are of interest for us, for instance data citation, including citation of dynamic data bases and data repositories, or certification of data repositories. Also lessons learnt in building the IVOA and data sharing in astronomy are injected in the discussion of RDA organisation and procedures. The RDA is a unique platform to meet data practitioners from many countries, disciplines and profiles, to grasp ideas to improve our data practices, to identify topics of common interest and to raise interesting subjects for discussion involving specialists from many disciplines and countries by proposing new Interest and Working Groups.},

  abstract = {Increasing attention is being paid to the importance and potential of crowd-sourced data to complement current environmental data-streams (i.e. in-situ observations and RS data). In parallel, the diffusion of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) that are interactive and easy to use have provided a way forward in facing extreme climatic events and the threatening hazards resulting from those. The combination of these two trends is referred to as ICT-enabled `citizen observatories' of the environment. Nevertheless, the success of these citizen observatories hinges on the continued involvement of citizens as central actors of these initiatives. Developing strategies to (further) engage citizens requires in-depth understanding of the behavioral determinants that encourage or impede individuals to collect and share environment-related data. This paper takes the case of citizen-sensed weather data using Personal Weather Stations (PWSs) and looks at the drivers and barriers for sharing such data via online amateur weather networks. This is done employing a behavioral science lens that considers data sharing a decision and systematically investigates the influential factors that affect this decision. The analysis and findings are based on qualitative empirical research carried out in the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Italy. Subsequently, a model was developed that depicts the main drivers and barriers for citizen participation in weather observatories. This resulting model can be utilized as a tool to develop strategies for further enhancing ICT-enabled citizen participation in climatic observations and, consequently, in environmental management.

In this review, I ask what makes data big' and what implications the size, density, or complexity of datasets have for the science of human development. A survey of existing datasets illustrates how existing large, complex, multilevel, and multimeasure data can reveal the complexities of developmental processes. At the same time, significant technical, policy, ethics, transparency, cultural, and conceptual issues associated with the use of big data must be addressed. Most big developmental science data are currently hard to find and cumbersome to access, the field lacks a culture of data sharing, and there is no consensus about who owns or should control research data. But, these barriers are dissolving. Developmental researchers are finding new ways to collect, manage, store, share, and enable others to reuse data. This promises a future in which big data can lead to deeper insights about some of the most profound questions in behavioral science. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Study design: We compared rates of contraceptive use from electronic extraction of EHR data via a data-sharing system and manual abstraction of the EHR among 142 female patients ages 15-49 years from a family medicine clinic within a primary care practice-based research network (PBRN). Cohen's kappa coefficient measured agreement between electronic extraction and manual abstraction. Results: Manual abstraction identified 62\% of women as contraceptive users, whereas electronic extraction identified only 27\%. Long acting reversible (LARC) methods had 96\% agreement (Cohen's kappa 0.78; confidence interval, 0.57-0.99) between electronic extraction and manual abstraction. EHR data extracted via a data-sharing system was unable to identify barrier or over-the-counter contraceptives. Conclusions: Electronic extraction found substantially lower overall rates of contraceptive method use, but produced more comparable LARC method use rates when compared to manual abstraction among women in this study's primary care clinic. Implications: Quality metrics related to contraceptive use that rely on EHR data in this study's data-sharing system likely under-estimated true contraceptive use. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Design - Electronic survey. Setting - ProQuest's Community of Science Scholars database. Subjects - Included 2,193 randomly selected social scientists associated with U.S. academic institutions. Methods - An electronic survey was distributed to a random sample of U.S.-based social science scholars from ProQuest's Community of Science Scholars database. The survey adapted 21 measurement items for constructs taken from the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the technology acceptance model (TAM), including perceived usefulness, perceived effort, and the subjective norm surrounding data reuse. Main Results - There were 292 valid responses received, giving a response rate of 14.91\%. Survey data largely validated the authors' theoretical model. Attitudinal, normative, and resource factors all influence social scientists' intended data reuse. In particular, perceived usefulness of reusing data and subjective norms surrounding data reuse in one's discipline positively correlate with intentions to reuse data, and perceived concern of reusing data negatively correlate with intentions to reuse data. Conclusion - Data reuse in the social sciences is influenced by the perceptions and beliefs held by social scientists. Social scientists reuse others' data when they perceive that doing so would improve their research productivity and when their discipline has strong norms of data reuse. They avoid reusing others' data when they believe that doing so is problematic (e.g., if they believe reusing infringes on copyright). Supporters of data sharing, including librarians, are encouraged to apply these findings by proactively educating researchers on the benefits, potential obstacles, and methods of data reuse.},

It may be especially important to make data available for the most influential studies that have provided a foundation for subsequent research and theory development. Therefore, we launched an initiativethe Data Arkto examine whether we could retrospectively enhance the preservation and accessibility of important scientific data.

The theory of planned behavior was employed to demonstrate how these factors influence behavioral intentions to adopt an open data badge. This research used a survey method to examine to what extent those attitudinal, normative, resource factors influence psychologists' behavioral intentions to adopt an open data badge, and therefore engage in data sharing behaviors. A national survey (n= 341) across the field of psychology showed that perceived benefit and perceived risk had significant positive and negative relationships with attitude toward the open data badge respectively. Furthermore, attitude toward open data badge and norm of data sharing had significant positive influences on psychologists' behavioral intentions to adopt the open data badge. Perceived effort had a significant negative relationship with the behavioral intention to adopt the open data badge, but had no effect toward attitudes surrounding the badge. However, this research found that the availability of a data repository and pressure from an open science journal did not have any significant relationship with behavioral intention to adopt the open data badge. The discussion includes implications for psychologists from both practical and theoretical perspectives. Additionally, future directions for gauging psychologists' adoption of the open data badge and increasing data sharing behaviors are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: Health education and behavior change programs targeting specific risk factors have demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing the development of future diseases. Alzheimer disease (AD) shares many of the same risk factors, most of which can be addressed via behavior change. It is therefore theorized that a behavior change intervention targeting these risk factors would likely result in favorable rates of AD prevention. Objective: The objective of this study was to reduce the future risk of developing AD, while in the short term promoting vascular health, through behavior change. Methods: The study was an interventional randomized controlled trial consisting of subjects who were randomly assigned into either treatment (n=102) or control group (n=42). Outcome measures included various blood-based biomarkers, anthropometric measures, and behaviors related to AD risk. The treatment group was provided with a bespoke ``Gray Matters'' mobile phone app designed to encourage and facilitate behavior change. The app presented evidence-based educational material relating to AD risk and prevention strategies, facilitated self-reporting of behaviors across 6 behavioral domains, and presented feedback on the user's performance, calculated from reported behaviors against recommended guidelines. Results: This paper explores the rationale for a mobile phone-led intervention and details the app's effect on behavior change and subsequent clinical outcomes. Via the app, the average participant submitted 7.3 (SD 3.2) behavioral logs/day (n=122,719). Analysis of these logs against primary outcome measures revealed that participants who improved their high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels during the study duration answered a statistically significant higher number of questions per day (mean 8.30, SD 2.29) than those with no improvement (mean 6.52, SD 3.612), t(97.74)=-3.051, P=.003. Participants who decreased their body mass index (BMI) performed significantly better in attaining their recommended daily goals (mean 56.21 SD 30.4\%) than those who increased their BMI (mean 40.12 SD 29.1\%), t(80)=-2.449, P=.017. In total, 69.2\% (n=18) of those who achieved a mean performance percentage of 60\% or higher, across all domains, reduced their BMI during the study, whereas 60.7\% (n=34) who did not, increased their BMI. One-way analysis of variance of systolic blood pressure category changes showed a significant correlation between reported efforts to reduce stress and category change as a whole, P=.035. An exit survey highlighted that respondents (n=83) reported that the app motivated them to perform physical activity (85.4\%) and make healthier food choices (87.5\%). Conclusions: In this study, the ubiquitous nature of the mobile phone excelled as a delivery platform for the intervention, enabling the dissemination of educational intervention material while simultaneously monitoring and encouraging positive behavior change, resulting in desirable clinical effects. Sustained effort to maintain the achieved behaviors is expected to mitigate future AD risk.},

  abstract = {Data sharing is becoming increasingly common, but despite encouragement and facilitation by funding agencies, journals, and some research efforts, most neuroimaging data acquired today is still not shared due to political, financial, social, and technical barriers to sharing data that remain. In particular, technical solutions are few for researchers that are not a part of larger efforts with dedicated sharing infrastructures, and social barriers such as the time commitment required to share can keep data from becoming publicly available. We present a system for sharing neuroimaging data, designed to be simple to use and to provide benefit to the data provider. The system consists of a server at the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) and user tools for uploading data to the server. The primary design principle for the user tools is ease of use: the user identifies a directory containing Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data, provides their INCF Portal authentication, and provides identifiers for the subject and imaging session. The user tool anonymizes the data and sends it to the server. The server then runs quality control routines on the data, and the data and the quality control reports are made public. The user retains control of the data and may change the sharing policy as they need. The result is that in a few minutes of the user's time, DICOM data can be anonymized and made publicly available, and an initial quality control assessment can be performed on the data.},

We sought to identify the issues around ethical data sharing in the context of research involving women and children in urban India. We interviewed researchers, managers, and research participants associated with a Mumbai non-governmental organization, as well as researchers from other organizations and members of ethics committees. We conducted 22 individual semi-structured interviews and involved 44 research participants in focus group discussions. We used framework analysis to examine ideas about data and data sharing in general; its potential benefits or harms, barriers, obligations, and governance; and the requirements for consent. Both researchers and participants were generally in favor of data sharing, although limited experience amplified their reservations. We identified three themes: concerns that the work of data producers may not receive appropriate acknowledgment, skepticism about the process of sharing, and the fact that the terrain of data sharing was essentially uncharted and confusing. To increase data sharing in India, we need to provide guidelines, protocols, and examples of good practice in terms of consent, data preparation, screening of applications, and what individuals and organizations can expect in terms of validation, acknowledgment, and authorship.},

At the workshop, experts from universities and research institutes presented databases, studies, organizations and tools that attempt to deal with these problems. Furthermore, a case study showing that combining toxicogenomics data from multiple resources leads to more accurate predictions in risk assessment was presented. All participants agreed that there is a need for a web portal describing the diverse, heterogeneous data resources relevant for toxicogenomics research. Furthermore, there was agreement that linking more data resources would improve toxicogenomics data analysis. To outline a roadmap to enhance interoperability between data resources, the participants recommend collecting user stories from the toxicogenomics research community on barriers in data sharing and exchange currently hampering answering to certain research questions. These user stories may guide the prioritization of steps to be taken for enhancing integration of toxicogenomics databases.},

While the importance of these data is widely recognized, there are many challenges faced by researchers attempting to use such data. It is crucial to acknowledge and identify barriers to improve data sharing and access practices and ultimately optimize research capacity. Objective: To better understand the current state, explore opportunities, and identify barriers, an environmental scan of investigators at BC Children's Hospital Research Institute (BCCHR) was conducted to elucidate current local practices around data access and usage. Methods: The Clinical and Community Data, Analytics and Informatics group at BCCHR comprises over 40 investigators with diverse expertise and interest in data who share a common goal of facilitating data collection, usage, and access across the community. Semistructured interviews with 35 of these researchers were conducted, and data were summarized qualitatively. A total impact score, considering both frequency with which a problem occurs and the impact of the problem, was calculated for each item to prioritize and rank barriers. Results: Three main themes for barriers emerged: the lengthy turnaround time before data access (18/35, 51\%), inconsistent and opaque data access processes (16/35, 46\%), and the inability to link data (15/35, 43\%) effectively. Less frequent themes included quality and usability of data, ethics and privacy review barriers, lack of awareness of data sources, and efforts required duplicating data extraction and linkage. The two main opportunities for improvement were data access facilitation (14/32, 44\%) and migration toward a single data platform (10/32, 31\%). Conclusions: By identifying the current state and needs of the data community onsite, this study enables us to focus our resources on combating the challenges having the greatest impact on researchers. The current state parallels that of the national landscape. By ensuring protection of privacy while achieving efficient data access, research institutions will be able to maximize their research capacity, a crucial step towards achieving the ultimate and shared goal between all stakeholders-to better health outcomes.},

One major hurdle within the scientific community has been the lack of widely accepted standards for citing that data, making it difficult to track usage and measure impact. Within the neuroimaging community, there is a need for a way to not only clearly identify and cite datasets, but also to derive new aggregate sets from multiple sources while clearly maintaining lines of attribution. This work presents a functional prototype of a system to integrate Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) and a standardized metadata schema into a XNAT-based repository workflow, allowing for identification of data at both the project and image level. These item and source level identifiers allow any newly defined combination of images, from any number of projects, to be tagged with a new group-level DOI that automatically inherits the individual attributes and provenance information of its constituent parts. This system enables the tracking of data reuse down to the level of individual images. The implementation of this type of data identification system would impact researchers and data creators, data hosting facilities, and data publishers, but the benefit of having widely accepted standards for data identification and attribution would go far toward making data citation practical and advantageous.},

The searches were limited to papers published in the English language from 2001 to 2011. Results A total of 2917 titles were screened. From these, 18 papers describing the views of HCPs about data linkage or data sharing of routinely collected healthcare data at an individual patient level were included. Views were generally positive, and potential benefits were reported. Facilitators included having trust in the system including data governance, reliability, and feedback. Some negative views, identified as barriers were also expressed including costs, data governance, technical issues, and privacy concerns. Effects on the physician-patient relationship, and workload were also identified as deterrent. Discussion From the published literature included in this review, the views of HCPs were in general positive towards data sharing for public health purposes. The identification of barriers to contributing to a data linkage system allows these to be addressed in a planned data linkage project for pharmacovigilance. The main barriers identified were concerns about costs, governance and interference with the prescriber-patient relationship. These would have to be addressed if healthcare professionals are to support a data linkage system to improve patient safety.},

Study Design and Setting: Web-based survey of Directors of 45 UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC)-registered CTUs. Results: Twenty-three (51\%) CTUs responded: Five (22\%) of these had an established data sharing policy and eight (35\%) specifically requested consent to use patient data beyond the scope of the original trial. Fifteen (65\%) CTUs had received requests for data, and seven (30\%) had made external requests for data in the previous 12 months. CTUs supported the need for increased data sharing activities although concerns were raised about patient identification, misuse of data, and financial burden. Custodianship of clinical trial data and requirements for a CTU to align its policy to their parent institutes were also raised. No CTUs supported the use of an open access model for data sharing. Conclusion: There is support within the publicly funded UKCRC-registered CTUs for data sharing, but many perceived barriers remain. CTUs are currently using a variety of approaches and procedures for sharing data. This survey has informed further work, including development of guidance for publicly funded CTUs, to promote good practice and facilitate data sharing. (C) 2016 The Authors.

  abstract = {Many have argued that datasets resulting from scientific research should be part of the scholarly record as first class research products. Data sharing mandates from funding agencies and scientific journal publishers along with calls from the scientific community to better support transparency and reproducibility of scientific research have increased demand for tools and support for publishing datasets. Hydrology domain-specific data publication services have been developed alongside more general purpose and even commercial data repositories. Prominent among these are the Hydrologic Information System (HIS) and HydroShare repositories developed by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI). More broadly, however, multiple organizations have been involved in the practice of data publication in the hydrology domain, each having different roles that have shaped data publication and reuse. Bibliographic and archival approaches to data publication have been advanced, but both have limitations with respect to hydrologic data. Specific recommendations for improving data publication infrastructure, support, and practices to move beyond existing limitations and enable more effective data publication in support of scientific research in the hydrology domain include: improving support for journal article-based data access and data citation, considering the workflow for data publication, enhancing support for reproducible science, encouraging publication of curated reference data collections, advancing interoperability standards for sharing data and metadata among repositories, developing partnerships with university libraries offering data services, and developing more specific data management plans. While presented in the context of CUAHSI's data repositories and experience, these recommendations are broadly applicable to other domains.

While metadata and ontologies help overcome the problems of finding and interpreting data, the lack of clarity over licensing remains a real impediment to data reuse. Freedom from legal restriction and uncertainty is essential for the effective sharing, combining and deriving of data from these distributed collections. Reuse and recombination of data will be greatly facilitated by expanding the definition of the semantic web to include the semantics of data licensing. We aim to express licensing terms in a computable manner, within the context of research practice, enabling us to infer the resulting state of rights, obligations and conditions that are inherited by derived and recombined datasets, using a mixed bag of licenses. Building off this we aim to simulate the effects of varying licensing practices within communities, proposing a measure of health of our scholarly record based on compatibility and restrictiveness of the licenses contained therein.},

We recently conducted an international survey to ascertain the attitudes, experiences, and expectations regarding biodiversity data sharing and archiving of researchers. The results show that whereas most respondents are willing to share article-related biodiversity data, more than 60\% of respondents are unwilling to share primary data before publishing. Results indicate an underdeveloped culture of data sharing and several major technological and operational barriers. A major concern for researchers is appropriate benefits from data sharing. Most respondents would accept data archiving policies of journals. Researchers also express concerns about how to easily and efficiently deal with data and data quality in public databases. Expectations for biodiversity databases include standardization of data format, user-friendly data submission tools, formats for different types of data, and coordination among databases.

Based on this new metric, we found that the original publication of RCSB PDB in the year 2000 continues to attract most citations though many follow-up updates were published. None of these follow-up publications by members of the wwPDB organization can compete with the original publication in terms of citations and influence. Meanwhile, authors increasingly choose to use URLs of PDB in the text instead of citing PDB papers, leading to disruption of the growth of the literature citations. A comparison of data usage statistics and paper citations shows that PDB Web access is highly correlated with URL mentions in the text. The results reveal the trend of how authors cite a biomedical data repository and may provide useful insight of how to measure the impact of a data repository.},

The difficulty is that citizen science databases that comprise volunteer-generated observations are highly dynamic and contain data contributed by a very large number of volunteers. Moreover, the scientists re-using the citizen science data often only want to cite a small sub-set of the entire database, as it existed at a specific date and time. The majority of data citation approaches assume that the dataset is static, owned by a single agent and the entire dataset is being cited (not just a subset). This paper describes, implements and evaluates an innovative approach to dynamic data citation that potentially overcomes many of the challenges associated with citing sub-sets of constantly changing citizen science datasets and thus enables formal recognition of the volunteers who contributed the data.},

Two authors were involved in all stages of the review process; conflicts were resolved by consensus. Data was extracted independently using a pre-piloted data extraction template. Quality and bias were assessed using the QualSyst criteria for qualitative studies. Eighteen eligible articles were identified, and articles were categorised into four key themes: barriers, facilitators, access, and ownership; 14 subthemes were identified. While respondents were generally supportive of data sharing, concerns were expressed about access to data, data storage infrastructure, and consent. Perceptions of data ownership and acknowledgement, trust, and policy frameworks influenced sharing practice, as did age, discipline, professional focus, and world region. Young researchers were less willing to share data; they were willing to share in circumstances where they were acknowledged. While there is a general consensus that increased data sharing in health is beneficial to the wider scientific community, substantial barriers remain.},

Knowledge of species current distributions from data sharing is critical for the creation of watch lists and an early warning/rapid response system and for model generation for the spread of invasive species. We have created an on-line system to synthesize disparate datasets of non-native species locations that includes a mechanism to account for data sensitivity. Data contributors are able to mark their data as sensitive. This data is then `fuzzed' in mapping applications and downloaded files to quarter-quadrangle grid cells, but the actual locations are available for analyses. We propose that this system overcomes the hurdles to data sharing posed by sensitive data.},

  abstract = {Purpose - Owing to the recent surge of interest in the age of the data deluge, the importance of researching data infrastructures is increasing. The open archival information system (OAIS) model has been widely adopted as a framework for creating and maintaining digital repositories. Considering that OAIS is a reference model that requires customization for actual practice, this paper aims to examine how the current practices in a data repository map to the OAIS environment and functional components. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted two focus-group sessions and one individual interview with eight employees at the world's largest social science data repository, the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). By examining their current actions (activities regarding their work responsibilities) and IT practices, they studied the barriers and challenges of archiving and curating qualitative data at ICPSR. Findings - The authors observed that the OAIS model is robust and reliable in actual service processes for data curation and data archives. In addition, a data repository's workflow resembles digital archives or even digital libraries. On the other hand, they find that the cost of preventing disclosure risk and a lack of agreement on the standards of text data files are the most apparent obstacles for data curation professionals to handle qualitative data; the maturation of data metrics seems to be a promising solution to several challenges in social science data sharing. Originality/value - The authors evaluated the gap between a research data repository's current practices and the adoption of the OAIS model. They also identified answers to questions such as how current technological infrastructure in a leading data repository such as ICPSR supports their daily operations, what the ideal technologies in those data repositories would be and the associated challenges that accompany these ideal technologies. Most importantly, they helped to prioritize challenges and barriers from the data curator's perspective and to contribute implications of data sharing and reuse in social sciences.},

Metadata is structured information that describes and locates an information resource. It is the key to ensuring that a data set will be accessible into the future. With the rapid expansion of studies on biological responses to OA, the lack of a common metadata template to document the resulting data poses a significant hindrance to effective OA data management efforts. In this paper, we present a metadata template that can be applied to a broad spectrum of OA studies, including those studying the biological responses to OA. The ``variable metadata section'', which includes the variable name, observation type, whether the variable is a manipulation condition or response variable, and the biological subject on which the variable is studied, forms the core of this metadata template. Additional metadata elements, such as investigators, temporal and spatial coverage, and data citation, are essential components to complete the template. We explain the structure of the template, and define many metadata elements that may be unfamiliar to researchers.},

The major barrier to support fast data access in a data grid is the high latency of wide area networks and the Internet. Data replication is adopted to improve data access performance. When different sites hold replicas, there are significant benefits while selecting the best replica. In this paper, we propose a new replica selection strategy based on classification techniques. In this strategy the replica selection problem is regarded as a classification problem. The data transfer history is utilized to help predicting the best site holding the replica. The adoption of the switch mechanism of replica selection model avoids a waste of time for inaccurate classification results. In this paper, we study and simulate KNN and SVM methods for different file access patterns and compare results with the traditional replica catalog model. The results show that our replica selection model outperforms the traditional one for certain file access requests.},

  abstract = {Purpose: One of the major hurdles in enabling personalized medicine is obtaining sufficient patient data to feed into predictive models. Combining data originating from multiple hospitals is difficult because of ethical, legal, political, and administrative barriers associated with data sharing. In order to avoid these issues, a distributed learning approach can be used. Distributed learning is defined as learning from data without the data leaving the hospital. Patients and methods: Clinical data from 287 lung cancer patients, treated with curative intent with chemoradiation (CRT) or radiotherapy (RT) alone were collected from and stored in 5 different medical institutes (123 patients at MAASTRO (Netherlands, Dutch), 24 at Jessa (Belgium, Dutch), 34 at Liege (Belgium, Dutch and French), 48 at Aachen (Germany, German) and 58 at Eindhoven (Netherlands, Dutch)). A Bayesian network model is adapted for distributed learning (watch the animation: http://youtu.bei nQpqMIuHyOk). The model predicts dyspnea, which is a common side effect after radiotherapy treatment of lung cancer. Results: We show that it is possible to use the distributed learning approach to train a Bayesian network model on patient data originating from multiple hospitals without these data leaving the individual hospital. The AUC of the model is 0.61 (95\%Cl, 0.51-0.70) on a 5-fold cross-validation and ranges from 0.59 to 0.71 on external validation sets. Conclusion: Distributed learning can allow the learning of predictive models on data originating from multiple hospitals while avoiding many of the data sharing barriers. Furthermore, the distributed learning approach can be used to extract and employ knowledge from routine patient data from multiple hospitals while being compliant to the various national and European privacy laws.

Design/methodology/approach - The data reuse behaviour model of engineering researchers was investigated by using a survey method. A national survey was distributed to engineering researchers in the USA, and a total of 193 researchers responded. Findings - The results showed that perceived usefulness, perceived concerns and norms of data reuse have significant relationships with attitudes toward data reuse. Also, attitudes toward data reuse and the availability of data repositories were found to have significant influences on engineering researchers' intention to reuse data. Research limitations/implications - This research used a combined theoretical framework by integrating the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the technology acceptance model (TAM). The combination of the TPB and the TAM effectively explained engineering researchers' data reuse behaviours by addressing individualmotivations, norms and resource factors. Practical implications - This research has practical implications for promoting more reliable and beneficial data reuse in the engineering community, including encouraging positive motivations toward data reuse, building community norms of data reuse and setting up more data repositories. Originality value - As prior research on data reuse mainly used interviews, this research used a quantitative approach based on a combined theoretical framework and included diverse research constructs which were not tested in the previous research models. As one of the initial studies investigating data reuse behaviours in the engineering community, the current research provided a better understanding of data reuse behaviours and suggested possible ways to facilitate engineering researchers' data reuse behaviours.},

Method: A cuasiexperimental design of two groups (i.e., experimental groups and control group) with pretest and postest measurements was carried out. A 4-month intervention was implemented in 148 students from the Physical Activity and Sport Sciences university degree. Habits related to diet and physical activity were evaluated using a questionnaire (scaled from -40 a +50) and the teaching-learning process through a qualitative analysis. Results: At the end of the intervention, a very signifi cant improvement was found in the global value of the healthy lifestyle habits of the experimental group (+13,5), highlighting the improvement obtained in its higher level of compliance in the breakfast (53,4\%), in the number of diary meals (31,5\%), in the reduction of the consumption of soft-drinks (19,2\%) and in the increase of physical activity level, with an improvement of 12,3\% of participants with respect to the baseline levels.

Our aim is to investigate whether supplementary data files should be considered as a source of information for integrating the literature with biomolecular databases. Results: Using text-mining methods to identify and extract a variety of core biological database accession numbers, we found that the supplemental data files contain many more database citations than the body of the article, and that those citations often take the form of a relatively small number of articles citing large collections of accession numbers in text-based files. Moreover, citation of value-added databases derived from submission databases (such as Pfam, UniProt or Ensembl) is common, demonstrating the reuse of these resources as datasets in themselves. All the database accession numbers extracted from the supplementary data are publicly accessible from http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11771. Conclusions: Our study suggests that supplementary data should be considered when linking articles with data, in curation pipelines, and in information retrieval tasks in order to make full use of the entire research article. These observations highlight the need to improve the management of supplemental data in general, in order to make this information more discoverable and useful.},

Even though biodiversity is one of the fields where data is frequently reused, information about how data is reused and cited is not often openly accessible from research data repositories. This study explores data citation and reuse practices in biodiversity by using openly available metadata for 43,802 datasets indexed in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Quantitative analysis of dataset types and citation counts suggests that the number of studies making use of openly available biodiversity data has been increasing in a steady manner. Citation rates vary for different types of datasets based on the quality of data, and similarly to articles, it takes 2-3 years to accrue most citations for datasets. Content analysis of a random sample of unique citing articles (n=101) for 437 cited datasets in a random sample of 1000 datasets suggests that best practice for data citation is yet to be established. 26.7\% of articles are mentioned the dataset in references, 12.9\% are mentioned in data access statements in addition to the methods section, and only 2\% are mentioned in all three sections, which is important for automatic extraction of citation information. Citation practice was inconsistent especially when a large number of subsets (1250) were used. This calls for adoption of a standard citation model for this field to provide proper attribution when using subsets of data.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to locate individual, institutional, and resource factors that influence data sharing behaviors among social scientists. Given the benefits to the social science disciplines in the advancement of scholarship, and the recent data sharing policy changes of funding agencies, it is necessary to determine the factors that support and impede data sharing behaviors. A research model was developed and validated based on the results of a survey of 361 social scientists. The model is informed by theory of planned behavior and institutional theory to map underlying individual motivations, institutional pressures, and availability of resources facilitating social scientists' data sharing. It was found that social scientists' data sharing behaviors are mainly driven by personal motivations (i.e., perceived career benefit and risk, perceived effort, and attitude toward data sharing) and perceived normative pressure. Funding agencies' pressure, journals' pressure, and availability of data repository were not found to be significant factors in influencing social scientists' data sharing. This research suggests that personal motivations and norm of data sharing currently support social scientists' data sharing; however, institutional pressures by funding agencies and journals and data repository need to be further encouraged to better facilitate social scientists' data sharing behaviors.

Based on the theory of planned behavior, a research model focusing on beliefs, attitudes, norms, and resource factors was proposed. The research model was tested with a total of 1298 responses from a national survey in the United States (US). The data analysis results, using the partial least squares (PLS) technique, show that attitudinal beliefs (including perceived career benefit, risk, and perceived effort), disciplinary norms, and perceived availability of data repositories all have significant impacts on STEM researchers' attitudes toward data sharing, and further, both the attitude toward data sharing and the availability of data repositories have strong influences on researchers' data sharing behaviors. These results demonstrate that the theory of planned behavior is a useful theoretical framework for explaining STEM researchers' data sharing behaviors. From the practical perspective, this research suggests that information professionals can better serve STEM researchers by allocating their efforts in two ways: (1) Providing appropriate data services and tools to reduce researchers' efforts involved in data sharing, and (2) providing data repositories to facilitate researchers' data sharing behaviors.

As Korea does not have an institutional or regulatory framework governing data sharing, understanding the motivations and/or concerns of a Korean faculty might not only provide policy guidance for data-sharing practices in Korea but also help academic libraries of this country develop data management services valuable for researchers. In particular, survey responses from 190 professors and follow-up interviews with eleven faculty members were analyzed and revealed that professors who were more willing to openly share data tended to agree with data reuse conditioned on easy access to others' data, to have altruistic reasons for data sharing and to be uncertain about repositories and the demand for their data. Professors who were less willing to make data publicly available tended to fear exploitation and to be interested in exchanging data for control of access to such data, for approval of the dissemination of results based on such data, and for co-authorship and collaboration opportunities. The study suggested that policies might be designed to incentivize data sharing by including supporting data citation, allowing data providers to control access to data, and considering ethical issues and various co-authorship practices. It also discussed implications of the findings for academic librarians.},

  abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how data reuse experience, attitudinal beliefs, social norms, and resource factors influence internet researchers to share data with other researchers outside their teams. Design/methodology/approach - An online survey was conducted to examine the extent to which data reuse experience, attitudinal beliefs, social norms, and resource factors predicted internet researchers' data sharing intentions and behaviors. The theorized model was tested using a structural equation modeling technique to analyze a total of 201 survey responses from the Association of Internet Researchers mailing list. Findings - Results show that data reuse experience significantly influenced participants' perception of benefit from data sharing and participants' norm of data sharing. Belief structures regarding data sharing, including perceived career benefit and risk, and perceived effort, had significant associations with attitude toward data sharing, leading internet researchers to have greater data sharing intentions and behavior. The results also reveal that researchers' norms for data sharing had a direct effect on data sharing intention. Furthermore, the results indicate that, while the perceived availability of data repository did not yield a positive impact on data sharing intention, it has a significant, direct, positive impact on researchers' data sharing behaviors. Research limitations/implications - This study validated its novel theorized model based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). The study showed a holistic picture of how different data sharing factors, including data reuse experience, attitudinal beliefs, social norms, and data repositories, influence internet researchers' data sharing intentions and behaviors. Practical implications - Data reuse experience, attitude toward and norm of data sharing, and the availability of data repository had either direct or indirect influence on internet researchers' data sharing behaviors. Thus, professional associations, funding agencies, and academic institutions alike should promote academic cultures that value data sharing in order to create a virtuous cycle of reciprocity and encourage researchers to have positive attitudes toward/norms of data sharing; these cultures should be strengthened by the strong support of data repositories. Originality/value - In line with prior scholarship concerning scientific data sharing, this study of internet researchers offers a map of scientific data sharing intentions and behaviors by examining the impacts of data reuse experience, attitudinal beliefs, social norms, and data repositories together.},

  abstract = {Background               Many scholarly journals have established their own data-related policies, which specify their enforcement of data sharing, the types of data to be submitted, and their procedures for making data available. However, except for the journal impact factor and the subject area, the factors associated with the overall strength of the data sharing policies of scholarly journals remain unknown. This study examines how factors, including impact factor, subject area, type of journal publisher, and geographical location of the publisher are related to the strength of the data sharing policy.                                         Methods                                From each of the 178 categories of the Web of Science's 2017 edition of                 Journal Citation Reports                 , the top journals in each quartile (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4) were selected in December 2018. Of the resulting 709 journals (5\%), 700 in the fields of life, health, and physical sciences were selected for analysis. Four of the authors independently reviewed the results of the journal website searches, categorized the journals' data sharing policies, and extracted the characteristics of individual journals. Univariable multinomial logistic regression analyses were initially conducted to determine whether there was a relationship between each factor and the strength of the data sharing policy. Based on the univariable analyses, a multivariable model was performed to further investigate the factors related to the presence and/or strength of the policy.                                                        Results               Of the 700 journals, 308 (44.0\%) had no data sharing policy, 125 (17.9\%) had a weak policy, and 267 (38.1\%) had a strong policy (expecting or mandating data sharing). The impact factor quartile was positively associated with the strength of the data sharing policies. Physical science journals were less likely to have a strong policy relative to a weak policy than Life science journals (relative risk ratio [RRR], 0.36; 95\% CI [0.17\textendash 0.78]). Life science journals had a greater probability of having a weak policy relative to no policy than health science journals (RRR, 2.73; 95\% CI [1.05\textendash 7.14]). Commercial publishers were more likely to have a weak policy relative to no policy than non-commercial publishers (RRR, 7.87; 95\% CI, [3.98\textendash 15.57]). Journals by publishers in Europe, including the majority of those located in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, were more likely to have a strong data sharing policy than a weak policy (RRR, 2.99; 95\% CI [1.85\textendash 4.81]).                                         Conclusions               These findings may account for the increase in commercial publishers' engagement in data sharing and indicate that European national initiatives that encourage and mandate data sharing may influence the presence of a strong policy in the associated journals. Future research needs to explore the factors associated with varied degrees in the strength of a data sharing policy as well as more diverse characteristics of journals related to the policy strength.},

The relative merits of face-to-face instruction versus e-learning, especially in Primary Education, are still an open research issue, though. Another challenge that Primary Education faces is the development of STEM thinking and STEM-friendly attitudes in pupils of early ages. An educational intervention that attempts to address both issues is designed, implemented and evaluated in this paper. Motivation and engagement of young pupils are sought through the gamification of the learning process. The present study investigates the feasibility and the efficiency of an asynchronous e-learning scenario involving an on-line game, for pupils of 10-11 years, in the 5th grade of Primary School. A basic STEM subject, Computer Programming Principles, is selected as the learning material to be taught purely remotely, through the e-learning environment designed and developed in moodle, for the purposes of this research. The educational intervention provides data on the learning outcomes of the pupils and on the efficiency of the approach. Evaluation results verify both the feasibility and the efficiency of this approach. Pupils and parents emphasize the role of the teacher who provides support and guidance through the platform communication tools; their attitudes are seen to change in favor of e-learning.},

  abstract = {Background: Data sharing presents new opportunities across the spectrum of research and is vital for science that is open, where data are easily discoverable, accessible, intelligible, reproducible, replicable and verifiable. Despite this, it is yet to become common practice. Global efforts to develop practical guidance for data sharing and open access initiatives are underway, however evidence-based studies to inform the development and implementation of effective strategies are lacking. Objective: This study sought to determine the barriers and facilitators to data sharing among health researchers and to identify the target behaviours for designing a behaviour change intervention strategy. Method: Data were drawn from a cross-sectional survey of data management practices among health researchers from one Australian research institute. Determinants of behaviour were theoretically derived using well-established behavioural models. Results: Data sharing practices have been described for 77 researchers, and 6 barriers and 4 facilitators identified. The primary barriers to data sharing included perceived negative consequences and lack of competency to share data. The primary facilitators to data sharing included trust in others using the data and social influence related to public benefit. Intervention functions likely to be most effective at changing target behaviours were also identified. Conclusion: Results of this study provide a theoretical and evidence-based process to understand the behavioural barriers and facilitators of data sharing among health researchers. Implications: Designing interventions that specifically address target behaviours to promote data sharing are important for open researcher practices.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The opening of research data is emerging thanks to the increasing possibilities of digital technology. The opening of clinical trial (CT) data is a part of this process, expected to have positive scientific, ethical, health, and economic impacts thus contributing to research integrity. The January 2016 proposal by the International Council of Medical Journal Editors triggered ample discussion about CT data sharing and reconfirmed the need for an ongoing assessment of its dynamics. The IMProving Access to Clinical Trials data (IMPACT) Observatory aims to play such a role, and assess the data sharing culture, policies, and practices of key players, the impact of their interventions on CTs, and contribute to a transformation of research. The objective of this paper is to present the IMPACT Observatory as well as share some of its preliminary findings. Materials and methods: Methods include a scoping study of research, surveys, interviews, and an environmental scan of research data repositories. Results: Our preliminary findings indicate that although opening of CT data has not yet been achieved, its evolution is encouraging. Initiatives by key players contribute to increasing of CT data sharing, and many barriers are shrinking or disappearing. Conclusions: The major barrier is the lack of data sharing standards, from preparing data for public sharing to its curatorship, findability and access. However, experiences accumulated by sharing CT data according to ``upon request'' or ``open'' mechanisms could inform the development of such standards. The Vivli, CORBEL-ECRIN and Open Trials projects are currently working in this direction.},

  abstract = {Background The utilisation of available cross-European data for secondary data analyses on physical activity, sedentary behaviours and their underlying determinants may benefit from the wide variation that exists across Europe in terms of these behaviours and their determinants. Such reuse of existing data for further research requires Findable; Accessible; Interoperable; Reusable (FAIR) data management and stewardship. We here describe the inventory and development of a comprehensive European dataset compendium and the process towards cross-European secondary data analyses of pooled data on physical activity, sedentary behaviour and their correlates across the life course. Methods A five-step methodology was followed by the European Determinants of Diet and Physical Activity (DEDIPAC) Knowledge Hub, covering the (1) identification of relevant datasets across Europe, (2) development of a compendium including details on the design, study population, measures and level of accessibility of data from each study, (3) definition of key topics and approaches for secondary analyses, (4) process of gaining access to datasets and (5) pooling and harmonisation of the data and the development of a data harmonisation platform. Results A total of 114 unique datasets were found for inclusion within the DEDIPAC compendium. Of these datasets, 14 were eventually obtained and reused to address 10 exemplar research questions. The DEDIPAC data harmonisation platform proved to be useful for pooling, but in general, harmonisation was often restricted to just a few core (crude) outcome variables and some individual-level sociodemographic correlates of these behaviours. Conclusions Obtaining, pooling and harmonising data for secondary data analyses proved to be difficult and sometimes even impossible. Compliance to FAIR data management and stewardship principles currently appears to be limited for research in the field of physical activity and sedentary behaviour. We discuss some of the reasons why this might be the case and present recommendations based on our experience.},

  abstract = {Background: Improving nutrition knowledge among children may help them to make healthier food choices. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of a novel educational intervention to increase nutrition knowledge among primary school children. Methods: We developed a card game `Top Grub' and a `healthy eating' curriculum for use in primary schools. Thirty-eight state primary schools comprising 2519 children in years 5 and 6 (aged 9-11 years) were recruited in a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial. The main outcome measures were change in nutrition knowledge scores, attitudes to healthy eating and acceptability of the intervention by children and teachers. Results: Twelve intervention and 13 control schools (comprising 1133 children) completed the trial. The main reason for non-completion was time pressure of the school curriculum. Mean total nutrition knowledge score increased by 1.1 in intervention (baseline to follow-up: 28.3 to 29.2) and 0.3 in control schools (27.3 to 27.6). Total nutrition knowledge score at follow- up, adjusted for baseline score, deprivation, and school size, was higher in intervention than in control schools (mean difference = 1.1; 95\% CI: 0.05 to 2.16; p = 0.042). At follow- up, more children in the intervention schools said they `are currently eating a healthy diet' (39.6\%) or `would try to eat a healthy diet' (35.7\%) than in control schools (34.4\% and 31.7\% respectively; chi-square test p \textexclamdown{} 0.001). Most children (75.5\%) enjoyed playing the game and teachers considered it a useful resource. Conclusions: The `Top Grub' card game facilitated the enjoyable delivery of nutrition education in a sample of UK primary school age children. Further studies should determine whether improvements in nutrition knowledge are sustained and lead to changes in dietary behaviour.},

Consistent citation practice around data is essential to helping these benefits to be realized. Data citation metadata is being disseminated and used through its application programming interfaces and the Event Data application programming interface. Event Data extracts this information into a separate service, so data citations are pre-filtered from the Crossref metadata. There are two methods by which publishers can register data citation information with Crossref. The first method is to deposit data citations in the citation section of the metadata, i.e., the part containing the reference list of the article. The second method publishers can use to register data citations with Crossref is to use the relationships section of the metadata. There are a number of services already using Event Data to show information on data citation.

When several autonomous parties attempt to share data, there is not necessarily any guarantee that the participants will share data truthfully. In fact, there is often a large incentive to engage in behavior that can sabotage the effectiveness of such a system. We analyze these situations in light of game theory, a mathematical model which permits us to consider behavior and choices for any autonomous party. This paper uses this theory to create a behavior enforcement method that does not need a central management system. We use a simple punishment method that is inherently available in most scenarios. Our approach is applicable to a variety of assured information sharing applications where the members of a coalition have to work together to solve a problem.},

  abstract = {Open data is a global movement with the potential to generate significant social and economic benefits. Policies on open government data (OGD) inspire the development of new and innovative services that government agencies may lack. The International Open Data Charter adequately describes the importance of data mining. Governments that have signed this charter should focus on the following areas-(i) data mining, (ii) linkage, and (iii) in-depth analysis, i.e., distribution of open data that is freely accessible for elaborate analysis using machine reading. However, a series of practical difficulties is observed in connection with the data mining of OGD for in-depth analysis. First, most OGD do not have identifiers to prevent privacy disclosure. Second, owing to the nature of siloed data, the data sharing and collection methods vary with respect to heterogeneous OGD, and administrative or institutional barriers need to be overcome. This has created a demand for a novel technical solution that applies micro-aggregation and distance-based record linkage to address the aforementioned issues. Thus, in this study, a method capable of integrating two or more de-identified OGDs into one dataset to enable OGD data mining is proposed. In addition, the proposed method allows users to adjust the privacy threshold level to determine an appropriate balance between privacy disclosure risk and data utility. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated in terms of several metrics via extensive experimentation. This study emphasizes the importance of the research on efficient utilization of already-published OGDs, which has been relatively neglected in the past. Further, it broadens the research area for privacy-preserving data mining by proposing a method capable of mining heterogeneous data even in the absence of identifiers.},

Interstate PDMP data sharing has been called for by clinical practitioners, but evidence to support the effectiveness of PDMP data sharing is lacking. This study examined whether PDMP interstate data sharing with bordering states was associated with prescriptions of opioids. This was a cross-sectional study that included patients with non-cancer chronic pain from the 2014 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (weighted N = 66,198,751; unweighted N = 2846). Multinomial logistic regression was performed to examine the association between PDMP interstate data sharing status and patients' being prescribed opioids for pain treatment, controlling for covariates guided by the Eisenberg's model of physician decision-making. Findings indicated that patients residing in states with interstate PDMP data sharing with all or partial bordering states were not less likely to be prescribed opioids compared to those living in states without interstate data sharing. Other factors such as patient age, health insurance type, new patient status, and physician adoption of electronic medical records were associated with the likelihood of patients' being prescribed opioids. This study concluded that current practice of interstate PDMP data sharing with bordering states was not associated with patients' being prescribed opioids for non-cancer chronic pain treatment. Future studies and policy efforts that unravel technological, legal, and political barriers to reciprocal and equal interstate data sharing with bordering states should be warranted to inform PDMP redesign and in turn, augment overall PDMP effectiveness in reducing misuse of prescription opioids.},

The design and development of socio-educational and community projects in music training centres are tasks which, in using music as a tool towards mediation, can contribute to alleviate social dysfunctions in the nearby surroundings as well as to create social cohesion and feelings of community belonging and identity. Nevertheless, there is some inertia in the way things are done and a perpetuation of traditional models of education in music where there is no room for innovative projects with authentic social engagement. This paper will analyse the challenges and contexts that music schools face in the 21st Century at a social and community level, and how to address them with new educational models. The social commitment and engagement of music training institutions should spark a change in the design of activities through innovation as well as opening new avenues for collaboration with other social and institutional community actors. To illustrate these synergies as well as the design process of a socio-educational project, a proposal design of a socio-educational workshop will be put forth as a practical guide in the development of these programmes.},

  abstract = {This paper illustrates the potential use of the theory of planned behavior as a guiding framework for understanding intentions and behavior in geospatial data sharing in Tanzania. A structured questionnaire survey, was constructed and sent to local governments as well as academic and private organizations that are major producers and/or users of geodata. The questionnaire covered issues of how collection of geodata is financed, management of geospatial data, and compatibility of spatial data-sets. The theory was found to be generally effective in accounting for intentions to share geospatial data in Tanzania (p \textexclamdown{} .01). Results show potential for data sharing between local governments and other organizations in Tanzania, and it is suggested that creating awareness among spatial data stakeholders and the establishment of a spatial data infrastructure policy framework will speed up geospatial data sharing.},

  abstract = {With the development of biodiversity informatics, more and more data repositories have emerged, providing massive stores of open scientific data. The use of open data is increasingly valuable for scientific research and related decision making but little is known about which topics are addressed, especially in non-English publications. Further, how this data should be cited has been called into question. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is the world's largest and most widely-used open data access platform on the occurrence of species in nature. Here, we analyze the use of GBIF-mediated data in Chinese language publications. From 623 publications containing the word ``GBIF'', we obtained 324 peer-reviewed publications. Among these publications, there were 237 journal papers, 17 doctoral theses, 66 master theses, and 4 conference papers. The publications came from 114 journals and 49 research institutes and universities. We found that the most common topics addressed by these publications were species distribution, climate change, biological invasion and medicinal plants. For data citation, multiple forms coexist. 295 publications (90\% of publications) only cited the name of ``GBIF'' in the main text, without a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Among the 29 publications that cited GBIF in the references, 17 cited the GBIF website, 8 publications listed the URL of a species page in GBIF, and only 4 publications cited a DOI, which is what GBIF recommends. Based on a discussion on the use of GBIF-mediated data and the resulting data citation issues, this study makes three suggestions to improve data citation practice, which are applicable to data citation practice in other non-English publications.

An extensive literature addresses obstacles to global genomic data sharing, yet a series of public polls suggests that the scientific community may be overlooking a significant barrier: potential public resistance to data sharing across national borders. In several large United States surveys, university researchers in other countries were deemed the least acceptable group of data users, and a just-completed US survey found a marked increase in privacy and security concerns related to data access by non-US researchers. Furthermore, diminished support for sharing beyond national borders is not unique to the US, although the limited data from outside the US suggest variation across countries as well as demographic groups. Possible sources of resistance include apprehension about privacy and security protections. Strategies for building public support include making the affirmative case for global data sharing, addressing privacy, security, and other legitimate concerns, and investigating public concerns in greater depth.},

Many of its provisions support the creation of an ``Information Commons,'' an ecosystem of separate but interconnected initiatives that facilitate open and responsible sharing of genomic and other data for research and clinical purposes. For example, the Act supports the National Institutes of Health in mandating data sharing, provides funding and guidance for the large national cohort program now known as All of Us, expresses congressional support for a global pediatric study network, and strengthens patient access to health information. The Act also addresses potential barriers to data sharing. For example, it makes the issuance of certificates of confidentiality automatic for federally funded research involving identifiable, sensitive'' information and strengthens the associated protections. At the same time, the Act exacerbates or neglects several challenges, for example, increasing complexity by adding a new definition of ``identifiable'' and failing to address the financial sustainability of data sharing and the scope of commercialization. In sum, the Act is a positive step, yet there is still much work to be done before the goals of broad data sharing and utilization can be achieved.},

Nevertheless, with increased scrutiny on reproducibility and more funder mandates requiring sharing of data, the issues surrounding data sharing are moving beyond whether data sharing is a benefit or a bane to science, to what data should be shared and how. Here, we present an overview of these issues, specifically focusing on the sharing of so-called ``long tail'' data, that is, data generated by individual laboratories as part of largely hypothesis-driven research. We draw on experiences in other domains to discuss attitudes toward data sharing, cost-benefits, best practices and infrastructure. We argue that the publishing of data sets is an integral component of 21st-century scholarship. Moreover, although not all issues around how and what to share have been resolved, a consensus on principles and best practices for effective data sharing and the infrastructure for sharing many types of data are largely in place.},

Compliance with these policies has been hampered by reluctance, amongst many social and natural scientists, to release data on an open access basis. Dominant approaches to tackling data sharing obstacles focus on methodological, ethical, legal, scientific and technological infrastructures. This article explores barriers to data sharing through examination of the changing conditions and practices of data sharing; specifically, the recent introduction of digital data sharing policies and their institutionalization of open access as a normative data sharing model. The scientific, moral and political assumptions underpinning open access digital data sharing policies and principles are examined, and their implications considered for data sharing practices. The paper suggests that data sharing obstacles may be understood in terms of a policy-practice divide, whereby data sharing policies fail to recognize data sharing as a relational practice. In conclusion, alternative relational approaches to data sharing policies are proposed, drawing on the Mass Observation Archive guidelines as a useful illustrative model.},

Backpack Health is a global personal health record platform that harnesses the power of technology to connect users to their primary health data sources, the medical community, and researchers. By syncing with existing patient portals, health data can be stored on the Backpack Health platform and easily accessed and controlled by users in one connected interface. Individuals manage and collate their current and past conditions, genetic test results, symptoms, medications, procedures, labs, and other health data. Users are empowered to disseminate their information to clinicians, researchers, foundations, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies they connect with through the Backpack Health application. Here, we describe how two rare disease advocacy groups, The Marfan Foundation and Project Alive, utilize Backpack Health to connect with their target populations. Through secure transfer of pseudonymized data, groups can query their members to improve understanding of clinical features and to facilitate meaningful research. Responses to the groups' surveys show strong member engagement with high completion rates and increases in new Backpack Health users when surveys are deployed. Data from these surveys have been published and used to better inform clinical outcomes for treatment trials. By connecting users directly to the foundations, clinicians, researchers, and industry partners working on their condition, Backpack Health is instrumental in fast-tracking medical discoveries and treatment for rare diseases.},

This article examines variability in data and metadata practices using institutions as the key theoretical concept. Institutions, in the sense used here, are stable patterns of human behavior that structure, legitimize, or delegitimize actions, relationships, and understandings within particular situations. Based on prior conceptualizations of institutions, a theoretical framework is presented that outlines 5 categories of institutional carriers for data practices: (a) norms and symbols, (b) intermediaries, (c) routines, (d) standards, and (e) material objects. These institutional carriers are central to understanding how scientific data and metadata practices originate, stabilize, evolve, and transfer. This institutional framework is applied to 3 case studies: the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing (CENS), the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) network, and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). These cases are used to illustrate how institutional support for data and metadata management are not uniform within a single organization or academic discipline. Instead, broad spectra of institutional configurations for managing data and metadata exist within and across disciplines and organizations.},

The lack of a widely accepted method for giving credit to those who make their data freely available and for tracking the use of data throughout their life-cycle hampers data sharing.

Despite the environmental focus of INSPIRE, it offers limited guidance for archaeological datasets. Most primary data is created outside, but ultimately curated within, the public sector. As spatial evidence from fieldwork activities is not considered by the Directive, it overlooks a range of barriers to sharing data, such as project-based fieldwork, a lack of data standards, and formatting and licencing variations. This paper submits that these challenges are best addressed through the formalised management of primary research data through an archaeological Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). SDIs deliver more efficient data management and release economic value by saving time and money. Better stewardship of archaeological data will also lead to more informed research and stewardship of the historic environment. ARIADNE already provides a digital infrastructure for research data, but the landscape and spatial component has been largely overlooked. However, rather than developing a separate solution, the full potential of spatial data from archaeological research can and should be realised through ARIADNE.},

Well ahead of its time, the fMRIDC effort encountered logistical, sociocultural and funding barriers that impeded the field-wise instantiation of open-access data sharing. In 2009, ambitions for open-access data sharing were revived in the resting state functional MRI community in the form of two grassroots initiatives: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP) and its successor, the International Neuroimaging Datasharing Initiative (INDI). Beyond providing open access to thousands of clinical and non-clinical imaging datasets, the FCP and INDI have demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale data aggregation for hypothesis generation and testing. Yet, the success of the FCP and INDI should not be confused with widespread embracement of open-access data sharing. Reminiscent of the challenges faced by fMRIDC, key controversies persist and include participant privacy, the role of informatics, and the logistical and cultural challenges of establishing an open science ethos. We discuss the FCP and INDI in the context of these challenges, highlighting the promise of current initiatives and suggesting solutions for possible pitfalls. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

While few oppose data sharing philosophically, a range of barriers deter most researchers from implementing it in practice. To justify the significant effort required for sharing data, funding agencies, institutions, and investigators need clear evidence of benefit. Here, using the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative, we present a case study that provides direct evidence of the impact of open sharing on brain imaging data use and resulting peer-reviewed publications. We demonstrate that openly shared data can increase the scale of scientific studies conducted by data contributors, and can recruit scientists from a broader range of disciplines. These findings dispel the myth that scientific findings using shared data cannot be published in high-impact journals, suggest the transformative power of data sharing for accelerating science, and underscore the need for implementing data sharing universally.},

Design/methodology/approach               A decomposed theory of planned behaviour (TPB) is used as the conceptual framework to investigate a sample of 1,588 researchers from the major universities in Norway. Different latent construct models are analysed with a structural equation modelling approach.                                         Findings               The results show that the effect of habit was non-significant in an extended TPB framework where attitude was most important, followed by norms and perceived behavioural control in explaining intention to submit OA. Habit was only found to have a significant impact on intention to submit OA when it played a role as a full mediator for the effects of the intentional antecedents. In this modified model, norms were found to have a stronger effect than attitudes in explaining the habit to submit OA. OA habit strength forms intentions to publish in OA journals and reduces the intention to publish and publishing behaviour in NOA journals.                                         Research limitations/implications               Other individual forces (e.g. personality and personal values) and the role of habit strength should be included for future research.                                         Practical implications               The results provide empirical insights to management, policy makers and research on scholarly publishing.                                         Originality/value               This paper contributes not only to the understanding of OA scholarly publishing, but is also relevant for research on what drives (academic) data sharing, knowledge sharing, the sharing economy or the open source movement.},

  abstract = {This exploratory, qualitative study set out to identify the encountered and perceived barriers to public health (PH) data sharing in a Canadian province with a view to assessing blockchain technology as a potential solution. A topic guide was developed, based on previous research in the area. This was then utilised for ten in-depth, semi-structured interviews with PH professionals between 27 May and 18 June 2019. Each stage of research was congruent with the philosophical underpinning of Gadamerian hermeneutic phenomenology. The major themes that emerged from the data collected were related to the information systems in use, data quality and ownership, as well as client identity management. The recurring core theme throughout all interviews was related to ineffective leadership and management, contributing to each major theme. Overwhelmingly the results show that the majority of barriers faced in this province are human-related. It is concluded that while blockchain technology shows promise for enhancing data sharing in healthcare, it is still many years away from being implemented in this Canadian province. As the results of this study indicate, there are human related barriers that could be addressed in the meantime, which are outside the scope of a technical solution. Future work should explore the perspectives of other stakeholders, such as the provincial government to fully understand the potential for using blockchain to share PH data in this province.},

  abstract = {Maritime industries routinely collect critical environmental data needed for sustainable management of marine ecosystems, supporting both the blue economy and future growth. Collating this information would provide a valuable resource for all stakeholders. For the North Sea, the oil and gas industry has been a dominant presence for over 50 years that has contributed to a wealth of knowledge about the environment. As the industry begins to decommission its offshore structures, this information will be critical for avoiding duplication of effort in data collection and ensuring best environmental management of offshore activities. This paper summarises the outcomes of a Blue Growth Data Challenge Workshop held in 2017 with participants from: the oil and gas industry; the key UK regulatory and management bodies for oil and gas decommissioning; open access data facilitators; and academic and research institutes. Here, environmental data collection and archiving by oil and gas operators in the North Sea are described, alongside how this compares to other offshore industries; what the barriers and opportunities surrounding environmental data sharing are; and how wider data sharing from offshore industries could be achieved. Five primary barriers to data sharing were identified: 1) Incentives, 2) Risk Perception, 3) Working Cultures, 4) Financial Models, and 5) Data Ownership. Active and transparent communication and collaboration between stakeholders including industry, regulatory bodies, data portals and academic institutions will be key to unlocking the data that will be critical to informing responsible decommissioning decisions for offshore oil and gas structures in the North Sea.},

  abstract = {Introduction The last decade has seen many changes in graduate medical education training in the USA, most notably the implementation of duty hour standards for residents by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education. As educators are left to balance more limited time available between patient care and resident education, new methods to augment traditional graduate medical education are needed. Objectives To assess acceptance and use of a novel gamification-based medical knowledge software among internal medicine residents and to determine retention of information presented to participants by this medical knowledge software. Methods We designed and developed software using principles of gamification to deliver a web-based medical knowledge competition among internal medicine residents at the University of Alabama (UA) at Birmingham and UA at Huntsville in 2012-2013. Residents participated individually and in teams. Participants accessed daily questions and tracked their online leaderboard competition scores through any internet-enabled device. We completed focus groups to assess participant acceptance and analysed software use, retention of knowledge and factors associated with loss of participants (attrition). Results Acceptance: In focus groups, residents (n=17) reported leaderboards were the most important motivator of participation. Use: 16 427 questions were completed: 28.8\% on Saturdays/Sundays, 53.1\% between 17: 00 and 08:00. Retention of knowledge: 1046 paired responses (for repeated questions) were collected. Correct responses increased by 11.9\% (p\textexclamdown 0.0001) on retest. Differences per time since question introduction, trainee level and style of play were observed. Attrition: In ordinal regression analyses, completing more questions (0.80 per 10\% increase; 0.70 to 0.93) decreased, while postgraduate year 3 class (4.25; 1.44 to 12.55) and non-daily play (4.51; 1.50 to 13.58) increased odds of attrition. Conclusions Our software-enabled, gamification-based educational intervention was well accepted among our millennial learners. Coupling software with gamification and analysis of trainee use and engagement data can be used to develop strategies to augment learning in time-constrained educational settings.},

Despite the mounting requirements from funding agencies that the raw data is deposited as soon as (or even before) the paper is published, multiple factors often prevent data from being accessed and reused by other researchers. The situation with the human genomic data is even more dramatic, since on the one hand human genomic data is probably the most important data to share - it lies at the heart of efforts to combat major health issues such as cancer, genetic diseases, and genetic predispositions for complex diseases like heart disease and diabetes. On the other hand, since it is sensitive and personal information, it is often exempt from data sharing requirements. DNAdigest investigates the barriers for ethical and efficient genomic data sharing and engages with all stakeholder groups, including researchers, librarians, data managers, software developers, policy makers, and the general public interested in genomics. Repositive offers services and tools that reduce the barriers for data access and reuse for the research community in academia, industry, and clinics. To address the most pressing problem for public genomic data: that of data discoverability, Repositive has built an online platform (repositive.io) providing a single point of entry to find and access available genomic research data.},

In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, 63 clinical registries collect data on disease characteristics, treatment and outcome of various cancer diagnoses and groups based on process-related and outcome-related variables. Aim We describe the cancer-related clinical registries, compare organizational structures and quality indicators and provide examples of how these registries have been used to monitor clinical performance, develop prediction models, assess outcome and provide quality benchmarks. Further, we define unmet needs such as inclusion of patient-reported outcome variables, harmonization of variables and barriers for data sharing. Results and conclusions The clinical registry framework provides an empirical basis for evidence-based development of high-quality and equitable cancer care. The registries can be used to follow implementation of new treatment principles and monitor patterns of care across geographical areas and patient groups. At the same time, the lessons learnt suggest that further developments and coordination are needed to utilize the full potential of the registry initiative in cancer care.},

To address these problems, the potential path forward could include mandating data sharing for key sources, increasing transparency, and improving efficiency by making it easier for agencies to share data (including developing standards, templates, and incentives). We argue that an agency within the federal statistical system should serve as an intermediary for data integration across the federal statistical system and that the U.S. Census Bureau, with its experience and uniquely broad authority to seek data from any public or private entity for statistical purposes, is well positioned to fill this role.},

  abstract = {Spatial-Data Sharing (SDS) is a crucial aspect of spatial-data infrastructures. This paper introduces Social-Network Analysis to research on SDS. By mapping out relationships among social actors using Social-Network Analysis, the collective properties of SDS in organizations can be investigated. Previous theoretical approaches have focused exclusively on individual behaviour. This paper attempts to expand this focus and applies Social-Network Analysis in a study of SDS in a project of the Egyptian Survey Authority. It concentrates on the emerging pattern of SDS between social actors in the organization and their perceptions and attitudes. Social-Network Analysis results show that SDS in this organization corresponds strongly to the existing hierarchy in the organization. Individual beliefs and perceptions of SDS show patterns that correspond strongly to the network structure. Project leaders are central in the SDS network and optimistic about SDS. Workers lower in the organization feel they have less control and express more concern about constraints regarding SDS than workers higher up in the organization. The paper shows that Social-Network Analysis can be a useful tool to study SDS and complements approaches to individual behaviour. Social-Network Analysis could be expanded to study inter-organizational SDS, could be implemented with digital technology, and could be refined to distinguish behaviour and networks according to different information types.},

  abstract = {Background Cancer health disparities research depends on access to biospecimens from diverse racial/ethnic populations. This multimethodological study, using mixed methods for quantitative and qualitative analysis of survey results, assessed barriers, concerns, and practices for sharing biospecimens/data among researchers working with biospecimens from minority populations in a 5 state region of the United States (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas). The ultimate goals of this research were to understand data sharing barriers among biomedical researchers; guide strategies to increase participation in biospecimen research; and strengthen collaborative opportunities among researchers. Methods and Population Email invitations to anonymous participants (n = 605 individuals identified by the NIH RePORT database), resulted in 112 responses. The survey assessed demographics, specimen collection data, and attitudes about virtual biorepositories. Respondents were primarily principal investigators at PhD granting institutions (91.1\%) conducting basic (62.3\%) research; most were non-Hispanic White (63.4\%) and men (60.6\%). The low response rate limited the statistical power of the analyses, further the number of respondents for each survey question was variable. Results Findings from this study identified barriers to biospecimen research, including lack of access to sufficient biospecimens, and limited availability of diverse tissue samples. Many of these barriers can be attributed to poor annotation of biospecimens, and researchers' unwillingness to share existing collections. Addressing these barriers to accessing biospecimens is essential to combating cancer in general and cancer health disparities in particular. This study confirmed researchers' willingness to participate in a virtual biorepository (n = 50 respondents agreed). However, researchers in this region listed clear specifications for establishing and using such a biorepository: specifications related to standardized procedures, funding, and protections of human subjects and intellectual property. The results help guide strategies to increase data sharing behaviors and to increase participation of researchers with multiethnic biospecimen collections in collaborative research endeavors Conclusions Data sharing by researchers is essential to leveraging knowledge and resources needed for the advancement of research on cancer health disparities. Although U.S. funding entities have guidelines for data and resource sharing, future efforts should address researcher preferences in order to promote collaboration to address cancer health disparities.},

We examine the prevalence of data citation, documenting data sharing and reuse, in a sample of full text articles from the biological/biomedical sciences, the fields with the most public data sets available documented by the Data Citation Index (DCI). We develop a method that combines automated text extraction with human assessment for revealing candidate occurrences of data sharing and reuse by using terms that are most likely to indicate their occurrence. The analysis reveals that informal data citation in the main text of articles is far more common than formal data citations in the references of articles. As a result, data sharers do not receive documented credit for their data contributions in a similar way as authors do for their research articles because informal data citations are not recorded in sources such as the DCI.

A total of 34,491 cited records from the biology category of the Clarivate Analytics Data Citation Index were analyzed using descriptive comparison and multiple regression analysis to compare usage patterns of metadata elements between data records cited more than twice and those cited only once. Of the five types of metadata elements identified and examined, metadata elements that provided descriptions about datasets and author-related information dominantly appeared across datasets, whereas DOI and ORCID identifier were scarce. Metadata related to author and funding resources were found to be positive influential factors in predicting data reuse, whereas data descriptions and identifiers appeared to have negative influences.

This research sheds light on the current status of formal software citation that is captured by citation databases. Data for the study were gathered from more than 67,000 research software records available in public repositories indexed by Clarivate Analytics' Data Citation Index (DCI). The metadata characteristics of the indexed records and citation data were then analyzed. Research software was rarely cited in the DCI, suggesting that the documented reuse of research software rarely occurs or is not well documented. Institutional repositories attracted few citations and had low rate of citation. It proved impossible, however, using the available data to isolate specific identifiers that can promote formal software citation. The findings presented here offer insights into research software citation that will be of interest to funding agencies, publishers, researchers, and research organizations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Objectives: To improve feeding habits (breakfast, consumption of fruit and water, soft drinks, pastries, sweets and fried food) in adolescents. Methods: The intervention was conducted for 3 months in students from 12 to 16 years old, through an educational proposal based on a card game (built ad hoc) called ``Fighting for my health'', which was developed during the school breaks. This game was supplemented with the methodology of a healthy commitment, based mainly on the cooperative work between schools and families and the promotion of the responsibility among students about their health. Two groups were included (intervention and control), each one with a total number of 48 adolescents. Results: After the intervention, significant improvements were achieved in 5 of the 6 habits addressed (the exception was consumption of fried food) in the intervention group. Among them, it is necessary to highlight the significant difference (p \textexclamdown = 0.001) obtained in breakfast and consumption of fruit between pretest and posttest and between pretest and retest. However, in the control group there were no significant differences in any of them. Conclusion: A school-based intervention conducted from the Department of Physical Education, through healthy commitments using a card game, improved the feeding habits in adolescents.},

There is a need to replicate and confirm scientific findings to bolster confidence in many research areas. Data sharing also serves the critical function of allowing synthesis of findings across trials. As innovative statistical methods have helped resolve barriers to synthesis analyses, data sharing and synthesis can help answer research questions that cannot be answered by individual trials alone. However, the sharing of data among researchers remains challenging and infrequent. This article aims to (a) increase support for data sharing and synthesis collaborations among researchers to advance scientific knowledge and (b) provide a model for establishing these collaborations using the example of the ongoing National Institute of Mental Health's Collaborative Data Synthesis on Adolescent Depression Trials. This study brings together datasets from existing prevention and treatment trials in adolescent depression, as well as researchers and stakeholders, to answer questions about for whom interventions work and by what pathways interventions have their effects. This is critical to improving interventions, including increasing knowledge about intervention efficacy among minority populations, or what we call scientific equity. The collaborative model described is relevant to fields with research questions that can only be addressed by synthesizing individual-level data.},

Using a three-stage development process, the Guideline for Reporting Evidence-based practice Educational interventions and Teaching (GREET) checklist and accompanying explanatory paper were developed to provide guidance for the reporting of educational interventions for evidence-based practice (EBP). The aim of this study was to complete the final development for the GREET checklist, incorporating psychometric testing to determine inter-rater reliability and criterion validity. Methods The final development for the GREET checklist incorporated the results of a prior systematic review and Delphi survey. Thirty-nine items, including all items from the prior systematic review, were proposed for inclusion in the GREET checklist. These 39 items were considered over a series of consensus discussions to determine the inclusion of items in the GREET checklist. The GREET checklist and explanatory paper were then developed and underwent psychometric testing with tertiary health professional students who evaluated the completeness of the reporting in a published study using the GREET checklist. For each GREET checklist item, consistency (\%) of agreement both between participants and the consensus criterion reference measure were calculated. Criterion validity and inter-rater reliability were analysed using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). Results Three consensus discussions were undertaken, with 14 items identified for inclusion in the GREET checklist. Following further expert review by the Delphi panelists, three items were added and minor wording changes were completed, resulting in 17 checklist items. Psychometric testing for the updated GREET checklist was completed by 31 participants (n = 11 undergraduate, n = 20 postgraduate). The consistency of agreement between the participant ratings for completeness of reporting with the consensus criterion ratings ranged from 19 \% for item 4 Steps of EBP, to 94 \% for item 16 Planned delivery. The overall consistency of agreement, for criterion validity (ICC 0.73) and inter-rater reliability (ICC 0.96), was good to almost perfect. Conclusion The final GREET checklist comprises 17 items which are recommended for reporting EBP educational interventions. Further validation of the GREET checklist with experts in EBP research and education is recommended.

  abstract = {Background. Attribution to the original contributor upon reuse of published data is important both as a reward for data creators and to document the provenance of research findings. Previous studies have found that papers with publicly available datasets receive a higher number of citations than similar studies without available data. However, few previous analyses have had the statistical power to control for the many variables known to predict citation rate, which has led to uncertain estimates of the ``citation benefit''. Furthermore, little is known about patterns in data reuse over time and across datasets. Method and Results. Here, we look at citation rates while controlling for many known citation predictors and investigate the variability of data reuse. In a multivariate regression on 10,555 studies that created gene expression microarray data, we found that studies that made data available in a public repository received 9\% (95\% confidence interval: 5\% to 13\%) more citations than similar studies for which the data was not made available. Date of publication, journal impact factor, open access status, number of authors, first and last author publication history, corresponding author country, institution citation history, and study topic were included as covariates. The citation benefit varied with date of dataset deposition: a citation benefit was most clear for papers published in 2004 and 2005, at about 30\%. Authors published most papers using their own datasets within two years of their first publication on the dataset, whereas data reuse papers published by third-party investigators continued to accumulate for at least six years. To study patterns of data reuse directly, we compiled 9,724 instances of third party data reuse via mention of GEO or ArrayExpress accession numbers in the full text of papers. The level of third-party data use was high: for 100 datasets deposited in year 0, we estimated that 40 papers in PubMed reused a dataset by year 2, 100 by year 4, and more than 150 data reuse papers had been published by year 5. Data reuse was distributed across a broad base of datasets: a very conservative estimate found that 20\% of the datasets deposited between 2003 and 2007 had been reused at least once by third parties. Conclusion. After accounting for other factors affecting citation rate, we find a robust citation benefit from open data, although a smaller one than previously reported. We conclude there is a direct effect of third-party data reuse that persists for years beyond the time when researchers have published most of the papers reusing their own data. Other factors that may also contribute to the citation benefit are considered. We further conclude that, at least for gene expression microarray data, a substantial fraction of archived datasets are reused, and that the intensity of dataset reuse has been steadily increasing since 2003.},

The article concludes that data sharing for IWRM implementation cannot be radically improved without significant changes in the mindsets of the relevant organizations, and suggests how to achieve this.},

It is therefore important to be able to access IPD, and yet, obstacles persist that make it difficult for meta-analysts, as well as interested primary study analysts, to obtain it. In this paper, we discuss the barriers to obtaining IPD via online repositories or contacting primary study authors and provide an example data sharing agreement that can be used to ameliorate a few of these issues. We also discuss the ethics of data sharing. The goal of this paper is to help meta-analysts anticipate these potential barriers at the outset of their studies and hopefully increase the likelihood of producing thorough IPD syntheses and foster collaborative partnerships with primary study researchers.

  abstract = {Significant resources around the world have been invested in neuroimaging studies of brain function and disease. Easier access to this large body of work should have profound impact on research in cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry, leading to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric and neurological disease. A trend toward increased sharing of neuroimaging data has emerged in recent years. Nevertheless, a number of barriers continue to impede momentum. Many researchers and institutions remain uncertain about how to share data or lack the tools and expertise to participate in data sharing. The use of electronic data capture (EDC) methods for neuroimaging greatly simplifies the task of data collection and has the potential to help standardize many aspects of data sharing. We review here the motivations for sharing neuroimaging data, the current data sharing landscape, and the sociological or technical barriers that still need to be addressed. The INCF Task Force on Neuroimaging Datasharing, in conjunction with several collaborative groups around the world, has started work on several tools to ease and eventually automate the practice of data sharing. It is hoped that such tools will allow researchers to easily share raw, processed, and derived neuroirnaging data, with appropriate metadata and provenance records, and will improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging studies. By providing seamless integration of data sharing and analysis tools within a commodity research environment, the Task Force seeks to identify and minimize barriers to data sharing in the field of neuroimaging},

Although the understanding of how these collaborations work is growing, little is known about the barriers facing these partners at the local level. The objective of this study was to identify barriers to collaboration between primary care and public health at the local level in 4 states. Methods: The study team, which comprised 12 representatives of Practice-Based Research Networks (networks of practitioners interested in conducting research in practice-based settings), identified 40 key informants from the public health and primary care fields in Colorado, Minnesota, Washington State, and Wisconsin. The key informants participated in standardized, semistructured telephone interviews with 8 study team members in 2014 and 2015. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. We analyzed key themes and subthemes by drawing on grounded theory. Results: Primary care and public health participants identified similar barriers to collaboration. Barriers at the institutional level included the challenges of the primary care environment, in which providers feel overwhelmed and resources are tight; the need for systems change; a lack of partnership; and geographic challenges. Barriers to collaboration included mutual awareness, communication, data sharing, capacity, lack of resources, and prioritization of resources. Conclusions: Some barriers to collaboration (eg, changes to health care billing, demands on provider time) require systems change to overcome, whereas others (eg, a lack of shared priorities and mutual awareness) could be addressed through educational approaches, without adding resources or making a systemic change. Overcoming these common barriers may lead to more effective collaboration.},

  abstract = {Background: Diagnosis requires that clinicians communicate and share patient information in an efficient manner. Advances in electronic health records (EHRs) and health information technologies have created both challenges and opportunities for such communication. Methods: We conducted a multi-method, focused ethnographic study of physicians on general medicine inpatient units in two teaching hospitals. Physician teams were observed during and after morning rounds to understand workflow, data sharing and communication during diagnosis. To validate findings, interviews and focus groups were conducted with physicians. Field notes and interview/focus group transcripts were reviewed and themes identified using content analysis. Results: Existing communication technologies and EHR-based data sharing processes were perceived as barriers to diagnosis. In particular, reliance on paging systems and lack of face-to-face communication among clinicians created obstacles to sustained thinking and discussion of diagnostic decision-making. Further, the EHR created data overload and data fragmentation, making integration for diagnosis difficult. To improve diagnosis, physicians recommended replacing pagers with two-way communication devices, restructuring the EHR to facilitate access to key information and improving training on EHR systems. Conclusions: As advances in health information technology evolve, challenges in the way clinicians share information during the diagnostic process will rise. To improve diagnosis, changes to both the technology and the way in which we use it may be necessary.},

  abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine whether TAMS Analyzer and Viewshare are viable free and open source software data sharing and creation tools for those with limited funding and technological skills. Design/methodology/approach - The participant observer method was used to collect experiential evidence while applying the tools to a collection of text-, image-, and video-based digital cultural records. Findings - TAMS Analyzer was found to be a low barrier to entry tool for those with coding and qualitative data analysis experience. Those with general experience will be able to create datasets with the support of manuals and tutorials, while those with limited experience may find it difficult to use. Viewshare was found to be a low barrier to entry tool for sharing data online, and accessible for all skill levels. Research limitations/implications - TAMS Analyzer supports Mac and Linux platforms only, so a low-cost software recommendation was made for those in Windows environments. Practical implications - Librarians can use these tools to address data access gaps while promoting library digital collections. Social implications - With a greater understanding of data tools, librarians can be advisors, collaborators, agents for data culture, and relevant participants in digital humanities scholarship. Originality/value - The research evaluates both the capabilities of the tools and the barriers to using or accessing them, which are often neglected. The paper addresses a need in the literature for greater scrutiny of tools that are a critical component of the data ecology, and will further assist librarians when connecting scholars to tools of inquiry in an environment with limited funding and technical support.},

  abstract = {Background Genetic information of pathogens is an essential input for infectious disease control, public health and for research. Efficiency in preventing and responding to global outbreaks relies on timely access to such information. Still, ownership barriers stand in the way of timely sharing of genetic data from pathogens, frustrating efficient public health responses and ultimately the potential use of such resources in innovations. Under a One Health approach, stakeholders, their interests and ownership issues are manifold and need to be investigated. We interviewed key actors from governmental and non-governmental bodies to identify overlapping and conflicting interests, and the overall challenges for sharing pathogen data, to provide essential inputs to the further development of political and practical strategies for improved data sharing practices. Methods \& findings To identify and prioritize barriers, 52 Key Opinion Leaders were interviewed. A root-cause analysis was performed to identify causal relations between barriers. Finally, barriers were mapped to the innovation cycle reflecting how they affect the range of surveillance, innovation, and sharing activities. Four main barrier categories were found: compliance to regulations, negative consequences, self-interest, and insufficient incentives for compliance. When grouped in sectors (research institutes, public health organizations, supra-national organizations and industry) stakeholders appear to have similar interests, more than when grouped in domains (human, veterinary and food). Considering the innovation process, most of barriers could be mapped to the initial stages of the innovation cycle as sampling and sequencing phases. These are stages of primary importance to outbreak control and public health response. A minority of barriers applied to later stages in the innovation cycle, which are of more importance to product development. Conclusion Overall, barriers are complex and entangled, due to the diversity of causal factors and their crosscutting features. Therefore, barriers must be addressed in a comprehensive and integrated manner. Stakeholders have different interests highlighting the diversity in motivations for sharing pathogen data: prioritization of public health, basic research, economic welfare and/or innovative capacity. Broad inter-sectorial discussions should start with the alignment of these interests within sectors. The improved sharing of pathogen data, especially in upstream phases of the innovation process, will generate substantial public health benefits through increased availability of data to inform surveillance systems, as well as to allow the (re-) use of data for the development of medical countermeasures to control infectious diseases.},

The DCI harvests citations to research data from papers indexed in the Web of Science. It relies on the information provided by the data repository. The findings of this study show that data citation practices are far from common in most research fields. Some differences have been reported on the way researchers cite data: Although in the areas of science and engineering \& technology data sets were the most cited, in the social sciences and arts \& humanities data studies play a greater role. A total of 88.1\% of the records have received no citation, but some repositories show very low uncitedness rates. Although data citation practices are rare in most fields, they have expanded in disciplines such as crystallography and genomics. We conclude by emphasizing the role that the DCI could play in encouraging the consistent, standardized citation of research dataa role that would enhance their value as a means of following the research process from data collection to publication.},

Design: Observational study. Setting: The BMJ research archive. Participants: 160 randomly sampled BMJ research articles from 2009 to 2015, excluding meta-analysis and systematic reviews. Main outcome measures: Percentages of research articles that indicated the availability of their raw data sets in their data sharing statements, and those that easily made their data sets available on request. Results: 3 articles contained the data in the article. 50 out of 157 (32\%) remaining articles indicated the availability of their data sets. 12 used publicly available data and the remaining 38 were sent email requests to access their data sets. Only 1 publicly available data set could be accessed and only 6 out of 38 shared their data via email. So only 7/157 research articles shared their data sets, 4.5\% (95\% CI 1.8\% to 9\%). For 21 clinical trials bound by the BMJ data sharing policy, the per cent shared was 24\% (8\% to 47\%). Conclusions: Despite the BMJ's strong data sharing policy, sharing rates are low. Possible explanations for low data sharing rates could be: the wording of the BMJ data sharing policy, which leaves room for individual interpretation and possible loopholes; that our email requests ended up in researchers spam folders; and that researchers are not rewarded for sharing their data. It might be time for a more effective data sharing policy and better incentives for health and medical researchers to share their data.},

Through data sharing, a better understanding of current therapies in terms of their efficacy, safety and biomarker data profiles can be achieved. However, the sharing of these data sets involves a number of stakeholder groups including patients, researchers, private industry, scientific journals and professional societies. Each of these stakeholder groups has differing interests in the use and sharing of clinical trial and biomarker data, and the conflicts caused by these differing interests represent significant obstacles to effective, widespread sharing of data. Thus, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Biomarkers Committee convened to identify the current barriers to biomarker data sharing in immuno-oncology (IO) and to help in establishing professional standards for the responsible sharing of clinical trial data. The conclusions of the committee are described in two position papers: Volume I-conceptual challenges and Volume II-practical challenges, the first of which is presented in this manuscript. Additionally, the committee suggests actions by key stakeholders in the field (including organizations and professional societies) as the best path forward, encouraging the cultural shift needed to ensure responsible data sharing in the IO research setting.},

We use the results of a survey conducted by the working groups of the DataONE project to present a new-understanding of challenges to the development of global data collections and preservation by systematically examining the determinants of the researchers' likelihood to openly publish research data. This study found two key determinants affecting researchers' willingness to publish their data. First is data management in terms of data management skills and organization support. Second is the acknowledgement of the data set's originator in terms of appreciation and legal and policy requirements. This study also found that the impact of the significant determinants is contingent on the amount of data to be published. Finally, this study calls for further investigation to ascertain the relationship of data management and data quality, and systematic investigation on the roles and responsibility of government within these global data preservations.

  abstract = {Privacy-preserving data markets are one approach to restore users' online privacy and informational self-determination and to build reliable data markets for companies and research. We empirically analyze internet users' preferences for privacy in data sharing, combining qualitative and quantitative empirical methods. Study I aimed at uncovering users' mental models of privacy and preferences for data sharing. Study II quantified and confirmed motives, barriers, and conditions for privacy in data markets. Finally, in a conjoint study, trade-offs between decisive attributes that shape the decision to share data are analyzed. Additionally, differences between user groups with high and with low privacy concerns are observed. The results show that the anonymization level has the greatest impact on the willingness to share data, followed by the type of data. Users with higher privacy concerns are less willing to share data in data markets and want more privacy protection. The results contribute to an understanding of how privacy-preserving data markets could be designed to suit users' preferences.},

  abstract = {The constantly developing high content and high throughput screening (HCS \& HTS) microscopy and next generation sequencing technologies routinely produce experiment datasets in the terabyte (TB) or petabyte (PB) range resulting in millions of data files that can vary from simply numbers to signals and images. If the collaborators working on the same project are spread over large geographical distances, data sharing, interactive visualization and collaborative annotation techniques become important determinants of the success of a research project. On the other hand, there are hundreds of bioinformatic and cheminformatic databases, billions of documents in available literature, and many image based biological repositories, which need to be referred simultaneously to make sense out of the acquired data. To draw the conclusions from such increasingly complex and large scale data sources, the scientific community must be provided with simple to use methods to retrieve, analyze, visualize, annotate, and crosslink these data sources on a common platform in an efficient manner. However, on the other hand, these modern biological experiments and the subsequent analyses are completed with use of an array of different software suites and automated tools. A constant feedback from the experimenter is needed to change experimental paradigms for the follow-up experiments. Such a software platform to address the HCS data in these aspects does not exist yet, to the best of our knowledge. We have developed a simple to use software package called ``AskMe'' for users to publish their large scale biological experiment data on to the web by use of data mining and visualization concepts. With use of AskMe, scientists can share these HCS datasets easily with their collaborators or made publicly accessible to the whole scientific community. From the initial stages of experiments, AskMe can ease the experimental analysis process by mining data and providing useful visualizations. Moreover, integration and crosslinks to other databases also allow easy evaluation of data generated. By these principles, we bring the tools to the data and make the data access transparent to the users without any capacity tradeoff.},

Within the broad context of data citation, we focus on the automatic construction of citations problem for hierarchically structured data. We present the learning to cite framework, which enables the automatic construction of human- and machine-readable citations with different levels of coarseness. The main goal is to reduce the human intervention on data to a minimum and to provide a citation system general enough to work on heterogeneous and complex XML data sets. We describe how this framework can be realized by a system for creating citations to single nodes within an XML data set and, as a use case, show how it can be applied in the context of digital archives. We conduct an extensive evaluation of the proposed citation system by analyzing its effectiveness from the correctness and completeness viewpoints, showing that it represents a suitable solution that can be easily employed in real-world environments and that reduces human intervention on data to a minimum.},

  abstract = {Citations are the cornerstone of knowledge propagation and the primary means of assessing the quality of research, as well as directing investments in science. Science is increasingly becoming data-intensive, where large volumes of data are collected and analyzed to discover complex patterns through simulations and experiments, and most scientific reference works have been replaced by online curated data sets. Yet, given a data set, there is no quantitative, consistent, and established way of knowing how it has been used over time, who contributed to its curation, what results have been yielded, or what value it has. The development of a theory and practice of data citation is fundamental for considering data as first-class research objects with the same relevance and centrality of traditional scientific products. Many works in recent years have discussed data citation from different viewpoints: illustrating why data citation is needed, defining the principles and outlining recommendations for data citation systems, and providing computational methods for addressing specific issues of data citation. The current panorama is many-faceted and an overall view that brings together diverse aspects of this topic is still missing. Therefore, this paper aims to describe the lay of the land for data citation, both from the theoretical (the why and what) and the practical (the how) angle.},

NIH has required that genome-wide association study data be deposited in the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) since 2003. In 2013, a proposed updated policy extended this requirement to next-generation sequencing data. However, recent literature and anecdotal reports suggest lingering logistical and ethical concerns about subject identifiability, informed consent, publication embargo enforcement, and difficulty in accessing dbGaP data. We surveyed the International Genetic Epidemiology Society (IGES) membership about their experiences. One hundred and seventy five (175) individuals completed the survey, a response rate of 27\%. Of respondents who received data from dbGaP (43\%), only 32\% perceived the application process as easy but most (75\%) received data within five months. Remaining challenges include difficulty in identifying an institutional signing official and an overlong application process. Only 24\% of respondents had contributed data to dbGaP. Of these, 31\% reported local IRB restrictions on data release; an additional 15\% had to reconsent study participants before depositing data. The majority of respondents (56\%) disagreed that the publication embargo period was sufficient. In response, we recommend longer embargo periods and use of varied data-sharing models rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.},

  abstract = {Data sharing is essential for a better understanding of genetic disorders. Good phenotype coding plays a key role in this process. Unfortunately, the two most widely used coding systems in medicine, ICD-10 and SNOMED-CT, lack information necessary for the detailed classification and annotation of rare and genetic disorders. This prevents the optimal registration of such patients in databases and thus data-sharing efforts. To improve care and to facilitate research for patients with metabolic disorders, we developed a new coding system for metabolic diseases with a dedicated group of clinical specialists. Next, we compared the resulting codes with those in ICD and SNOMED-CT. No matches were found in 76\% of cases in ICD-10 and in 54\% in SNOMED-CT. We conclude that there are sizable gaps in the SNOMED-CT and ICD coding systems for metabolic disorders. There may be similar gaps for other classes of rare and genetic disorders. We have demonstrated that expert groups can help in addressing such coding issues. Our coding system has been made available to the ICD and SNOMED-CT organizations as well as to the Orphanet and HPO organizations for further public application and updates will be published online (www.ddrmd.nl and www.cineas.org).},

  abstract = {Open-data has created an unprecedented opportunity with new challenges for ecosystem scientists. Skills in data management are essential to acquire, manage, publish, access and re-use data. These skills span many disciplines and require trans-disciplinary collaboration. Science synthesis centres support analysis and synthesis through collaborative `Working Groups' where domain specialists work together to synthesise existing information to provide insight into critical problems. The Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (ACEAS) served a wide range of stakeholders, from scientists to policy-makers to managers. This paper investigates the level of sophistication in data management in the ecosystem science community through the lens of the ACEAS experience, and identifies the important factors required to enable us to benefit from this new data-world and produce innovative science. ACEAS promoted the analysis and synthesis of data to solve transdisciplinary questions, and promoted the publication of the synthesised data. To do so, it provided support in many of the key skillsets required. Analysis and synthesis in multi-disciplinary and multi-organisational teams, and publishing data were new for most. Data were difficult to discover and access, and to make ready for analysis, largely due to lack of metadata. Data use and publication were hampered by concerns about data ownership and a desire for data citation. A web portal was created to visualise geospatial datasets to maximise data interpretation. By the end of the experience there was a significant increase in appreciation of the importance of a Data Management Plan. It is extremely doubtful that the work would have occurred or data delivered without the support of the Synthesis centre, as few of the participants had the necessary networks or skills. It is argued that participation in the Centre provided an important learning opportunity, and has resulted in improved knowledge and understanding of good data management practices.

A foundational element of reproducibility and reusability is the open and persistently available presentation of research data. However, many common approaches for primary data publication in use today do not achieve sufficient long-term robustness, openness, accessibility or uniformity. Nor do they permit comprehensive exploitation by modern Web technologies. This has led to several authoritative studies recommending uniform direct citation of data archived in persistent repositories. Data are to be considered as first-class scholarly objects, and treated similarly in many ways to cited and archived scientific and scholarly literature. Here we briefly review the most current and widely agreed set of principle-based recommendations for scholarly data citation, the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (JDDCP). We then present a framework for operationalizing the JDDCP; and a set of initial recommendations on identifier schemes, identifier resolution behavior, required metadata elements, and best practices for realizing programmatic machine actionability of cited data. The main target audience for the common implementation guidelines in this article consists of publishers, scholarly organizations, and persistent data repositories, including technical staff members in these organizations. But ordinary researchers can also benefit from these recommendations. The guidance provided here is intended to help achieve widespread, uniform human and machine accessibility of deposited data, in support of significantly improved verification, validation, reproducibility and re-use of scholarly/scientific data.},

  abstract = {Developing or independently evaluating algorithms in biomedical research is difficult because of restrictions on access to clinical data. Access is restricted because of privacy concerns, the proprietary treatment of data by institutions (fueled in part by the cost of data hosting, curation, and distribution), concerns over misuse, and the complexities of applicable regulatory frameworks. The use of cloud technology and services can address many of the barriers to data sharing. For example, researchers can access data in high performance, secure, and auditable cloud computing environments without the need for copying or downloading. An alternative path to accessing data sets requiring additional protection is the model-to-data approach. In model-to-data, researchers submit algorithms to run on secure data sets that remain hidden. Model-to-data is designed to enhance security and local control while enabling communities of researchers to generate new knowledge from sequestered data. Model-to-data has not yet been widely implemented, but pilots have demonstrated its utility when technical or legal constraints preclude other methods of sharing. We argue that model-to-data can make a valuable addition to our data sharing arsenal, with 2 caveats. First, model-to-data should only be adopted where necessary to supplement rather than replace existing data-sharing approaches given that it requires significant resource commitments from data stewards and limits scientific freedom, reproducibility, and scalability. Second, although model-to-data reduces concerns over data privacy and loss of local control when sharing clinical data, it is not an ethical panacea. Data stewards will remain hesitant to adopt model-to-data approaches without guidance on how to do so responsibly. To address this gap, we explored how commitments to open science, reproducibility, security, respect for data subjects, and research ethics oversight must be re-evaluated in a model-to-data context.},

  abstract = {Background: ``Data to Care'' (D2C) is a public health strategy that uses surveillance and other data to improve continuity of HIV care for persons with HIV (PWH) by identifying those who are in need of medical care or other services and facilitating linkage to these services. The primary goal of D2C is to increase the number of PWH who are engaged in care and virally suppressed. Methods: Data to Care can be implemented using several approaches. Surveillance-based D2C is usually initiated by health departments, using HIV surveillance and other data to identify those not in care. Health care providers may also initiate D2C by identifying patients who may have fallen out of care and working collaboratively with health departments to investigate, locate, and relink the patients to medical care or other needed services. Results: Although D2C is a relatively new strategy, health department D2C programs have reported both promising results (eg, improved surveillance data quality and successful linkage to or re-engagement in care for PWH) and challenges (eg, incomplete or inaccurate data in surveillance systems, barriers to data sharing, and limitations of existing data systems). Conclusions: Data to Care is expected to enable health departments to move closer toward achieving national HIV prevention goals. However, additional information on appropriate implementation practices at each step of the D2C process is needed. This JAIDS Special Supplement explores how CDC funding to state health departments (eg, technical assistance and demonstration projects), and partnerships across federal agencies, are advancing our knowledge of D2C.},

  abstract = {Background: Scientific research in the 21st century is more data intensive and collaborative than in the past. It is important to study the data practices of researchers - data accessibility, discovery, re-use, preservation and, particularly, data sharing. Data sharing is a valuable part of the scientific method allowing for verification of results and extending research from prior results. Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 1329 scientists participated in this survey exploring current data sharing practices and perceptions of the barriers and enablers of data sharing. Scientists do not make their data electronically available to others for various reasons, including insufficient time and lack of funding. Most respondents are satisfied with their current processes for the initial and short-term parts of the data or research lifecycle (collecting their research data; searching for, describing or cataloging, analyzing, and short-term storage of their data) but are not satisfied with long-term data preservation. Many organizations do not provide support to their researchers for data management both in the short- and long-term. If certain conditions are met (such as formal citation and sharing reprints) respondents agree they are willing to share their data. There are also significant differences and approaches in data management practices based on primary funding agency, subject discipline, age, work focus, and world region. Conclusions/Significance: Barriers to effective data sharing and preservation are deeply rooted in the practices and culture of the research process as well as the researchers themselves. New mandates for data management plans from NSF and other federal agencies and world-wide attention to the need to share and preserve data could lead to changes.

  abstract = {The incorporation of data sharing into the research lifecycle is an important part of modern scholarly debate. In this study, the DataONE Usability and Assessment working group addresses two primary goals: To examine the current state of data sharing and reuse perceptions and practices among research scientists as they compare to the 2009/2010 baseline study, and to examine differences in practices and perceptions across age groups, geographic regions, and subject disciplines. We distributed surveys to a multinational sample of scientific researchers at two different time periods (October 2009 to July 2010 and October 2013 to March 2014) to observe current states of data sharing and to see what, if any, changes have occurred in the past 3-4 years. We also looked at differences across age, geographic, and discipline-based groups as they currently exist in the 2013/2014 survey. Results point to increased acceptance of and willingness to engage in data sharing, as well as an increase in actual data sharing behaviors. However, there is also increased perceived risk associated with data sharing, and specific barriers to data sharing persist. There are also differences across age groups, with younger respondents feeling more favorably toward data sharing and reuse, yet making less of their data available than older respondents. Geographic differences exist as well, which can in part be understood in terms of collectivist and individualist cultural differences. An examination of subject disciplines shows that the constraints and enablers of data sharing and reuse manifest differently across disciplines. Implications of these findings include the continued need to build infrastructure that promotes data sharing while recognizing the needs of different research communities. Moving into the future, organizations such as DataONE will continue to assess, monitor, educate, and provide the infrastructure necessary to support such complex grand science challenges.},

  abstract = {Healthcare costs in the United States have skyrocketed over the past decade, contributing to an estimated \$750 billion in wasteful spending annually. Despite the demand to improve residency education on value-based, cost-conscious healthcare, there is no consensus on how to best teach this practice. Traditional lectures have failed to demonstrate enduring change in clinical practice patterns, provider attitudes, and reductions in hospital expenditures. We sought to evaluate whether gamification is an effective pedagogical tool to teach cost-consciousness to emergency medicine (EM) residents by creating a 60-minute interactive session based on the popular gameshow, the Price is Right. Costs and associated charges for common laboratory tests, radiographic studies, medications, and common physical resources typically found in the emergency department (ED) were first obtained through direct communication with the ED clinical director and hospital leadership. The session itself consisted of three phases with several Price-is-Right-themed games, which included realistic visual stimuli reminiscent of the gameshow that were created by the authors using the PowerPoint. Formal quantitative and qualitative feedback was solicited at the end of the session. Quantitative evaluation of the educational intervention was obtained through a 22-item questionnaire using a five-point Likert-type scale from 19 of the 22 enrolled residents (86\% response rate). Responses were generally very positive with an overall course rating score of 4.16 (SD +/- 0.90). Qualitative feedback identified learners' predilection for gamified delivery of nonclinical content during conference. The majority of residents (89\%) recommend the activity to be used in subsequent offerings to other learners. With healthcare costs on the rise, our feasibility study demonstrated that gamification is an effective way to teach mindful, cost-conscious care to EM residents. Gamification offers a fun and engaging alternative that should be further utilized in EM educational formats. Future studies are needed to longitudinally assess the learner retention and cost-containment practices.},

  abstract = {Purpose Chemical databases have had a significant impact on the way scientists search for and use information. The purpose of this paper is to spark informed discussion and fuel debate on the issue of citations to chemical databases. Design/methodology/approach A citation analysis to four major chemical databases was undertaken to examine resource coverage and impact in the scientific literature. Two commercial databases (SciFinder and Reaxys) and two public databases (PubChem and ChemSpider) were analyzed using the ``Cited Reference Search'' in the Science Citation Index Expanded from the Web of Science (WoS) database. Citations to these databases between 2000 and 2016 (inclusive) were evaluated by document types and publication growth curves. A review of the distribution trends of chemical databases in peer-reviewed articles was conducted through a citation count analysis by country, organization, journal and WoS category. Findings In total, 862 scholarly articles containing a citation to one or more of the four databases were identified as only steadily increasing since 2000. The study determined that authors at academic institutions worldwide reference chemical databases in high-impact journals from notable publishers and mainly in the field of chemistry. Originality/value The research is a first attempt to evaluate the practice of citation to major chemical databases in the scientific literature. This paper proposes that citing chemical databases gives merit and recognition to the resources as well as credibility and validity to the scholarly communication process and also further discusses recommendations for citing and referencing databases.},

  abstract = {Background: In the current information age, the use of data has become essential for decision making in public health at the local, national, and global level. Despite a global commitment to the use and sharing of public health data, this can be challenging in reality. No systematic framework or global operational guidelines have been created for data sharing in public health. Barriers at different levels have limited data sharing but have only been anecdotally discussed or in the context of specific case studies. Incomplete systematic evidence on the scope and variety of these barriers has limited opportunities to maximize the value and use of public health data for science and policy. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of potential barriers to public health data sharing. Documents that described barriers to sharing of routinely collected public health data were eligible for inclusion and reviewed independently by a team of experts. We grouped identified barriers in a taxonomy for a focused international dialogue on solutions. Results: Twenty potential barriers were identified and classified in six categories: technical, motivational, economic, political, legal and ethical. The first three categories are deeply rooted in well-known challenges of health information systems for which structural solutions have yet to be found; the last three have solutions that lie in an international dialogue aimed at generating consensus on policies and instruments for data sharing. Conclusions: The simultaneous effect of multiple interacting barriers ranging from technical to intangible issues has greatly complicated advances in public health data sharing. A systematic framework of barriers to data sharing in public health will be essential to accelerate the use of valuable information for the global good.},

Due to the volume and heterogeneity of these data, it is a challenging task to find and consume them. To reduce the barrier of data sharing and reuse on the Web, we propose a data cataloguing framework called WDFed that combines the strength of both Linked Data and REST. WDFed adopts the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) to harmonise database metadata, and develops a two-way mapping between DCAT and a RESTful API. This framework provides an interoperable middle layer that enables humans as well as applications to discover and consume Big Data on the Web in a semi-automatic manner. The framework is implemented in a data portal called Web Observatory and we present several use cases to evaluate the framework.},

Design Retrospective observational study using Hospital Episode Statistics. Setting Acute hospital trusts in the NHS in England. Participants All adult patients resident in England that had one or more inpatient, outpatient or accident and emergency encounters at acute NHS hospital trusts between April 2017 and April 2018. Primary and secondary outcome measures Frequency of use and spatial distribution of health record systems. Frequency and spatial distribution of transitions of care between hospital trusts and health record systems. Results 21 286 873 patients were involved in 121 351 837 encounters at 152 included trusts. 117 (77.0\%) hospital trusts were using electronic health records (EHR). There was limited regional alignment of EHR systems. On 11 017 767 (9.1\%) occasions, patients attended a hospital using a different health record system to their previous hospital attendance. 15 736 863 (73.9\%) patients had two or more encounters with the included trusts and 3 931 255 (25.0\%) of those attended two or more trusts. Over half (53.6\%) of these patients had encounters shared between just 20 pairs of hospitals. Only two of these pairs of trusts used the same EHR system. Conclusions Each year, millions of patients in England attend two or more different hospital trusts. Most of the pairs of trusts that commonly share patients do not use the same record systems. This research highlights significant barriers to inter-hospital data sharing and interoperability. Findings from this study can be used to improve electronic health record system coordination and develop targeted approaches to improve interoperability. The methods used in this study could be used in other healthcare systems that face the same interoperability challenges.},

This article expands on the data sharing component of a paper presented at the 2013 ASIST conference. A three-phase project is reported. Conducted between 2011 and 2013 within an environmental voluntary group, the Australian Plants Society Victoria (APSV), the interviews of the first phase are the major data source. Because the project revealed the importance of data sharing with professional scientists, their views are included in the literature review where four themes are explored: lack of shared disciplinary culture, trust, responsibility and controlled access to data, and describing data to enable reuse. The findings, presented under these themes, revealed that, within APSV, sharing among members is mostly generous and uninhibited. Beyond APSV, when online repositories were involved, barriers came very strongly into play. Trust was weaker and barriers also included issues of data quality, data description, and ownership and control. The conclusion is that further investigation of these barriers, including the attitudes of professional scientists to using data contributed by citizen scientists, would indicate how more extensive and useful data sharing could be achieved.},

Funding organizations such as the British Wellcome Trust therefore have developed data sharing policies and request commitment to data management and sharing in grant applications. Increased citation rates are a profound argument for sharing publication data. Pre-publication sharing might be rewarded by a data citation credit system via digital object identifiers (DOIs) which have initially been in use for data objects. Besides policies and incentives, good practice in data management is indispensable. However, appropriate systems for data management of large-scale projects for example in systems biology are hard to find. Here, we give an overview of a selection of open-source data management systems proved to be employed successfully in large-scale projects.},

  abstract = {Clinical data exchange across organisational boundary is essential but not straightforward, since it involves a diverse range of systems that maintain not just incompatible data formats but also their autonomy. This is barrier of substantial significance not only to improved care for individuals whereas data sharing is essential to clinical decisions, but also administrative strategies and resource allocation for an entire population whereas datasets need to be aggregated. The Hubei Provincial Department of Health recently launched an initiative of a province-wide data exchange standard. Under investigation by the authors, the standard will guide vendors to implement a set of hierarchical platforms at various administrative levels, and connect clinical information systems to them and join the data exchange network. In this paper, we will describe the data exchange requirements in the province, the design of a service paradigm and specification of Clinical Document Architecture (CDA), as well as governing protocols towards the goal. A case study on patients with hypertension, from detection, diagnosis, referral, treatment, onwards to follow-up will be used for illustration. The work contributes a semantic and functional data exchange model, and will further support data analysis to both clinical and administrative decision-making in this province.},

The California Department of Public Health recently started to partner with certain hospitals in the state to better understand cancer trends by collecting and securely sending standardized cancer data directly to the California Cancer Registry. This initiative is the first of its kind in the United States. This has afforded the cancer registry the opportunity to perform real-time surveillance on data reported via participating hospitals, and researchers can use advanced methods to analyze these data. Other states are likely to follow California's lead. However, there are barriers to increased data-sharing efforts. How these barriers can be addressed to facilitate data sharing while protecting individual privacy, reducing the risk of data misuse, and enhancing public trust becomes critical as precision medicine moves forward.},

  abstract = {The medical and machine learning communities are relying on the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) to transform medicine through enabling more accurate decisions and personalized treatment. However, progress is slow. Legal and ethical issues around unconsented patient data and privacy is one of the limiting factors in data sharing, resulting in a significant barrier in accessing routinely collected electronic health records (EHR) by the machine learning community. We propose a novel framework for generating synthetic data that closely approximates the joint distribution of variables in an original EHR dataset, providing a readily accessible, legally and ethically appropriate solution to support more open data sharing, enabling the development of AI solutions. In order to address issues around lack of clarity in defining sufficient anonymization, we created a quantifiable, mathematical definition for ``identifiability''. We used a conditional generative adversarial networks (GAN) framework to generate synthetic data while minimize patient identifiability that is defined based on the probability of re-identification given the combination of all data on any individual patient. We compared models fitted to our synthetically generated data to those fitted to the real data across four independent datasets to evaluate similarity in model performance, while assessing the extent to which original observations can be identified from the synthetic data. Our model, ADS-GAN, consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrated reliability in the joint distributions. We propose that this method could be used to develop datasets that can be made publicly available while considerably lowering the risk of breaching patient confidentiality.},

This method is based on Oracle Spatial, through which spatial data interoperability for multi-platform of GIS is available. The results of experiments demonstrate that this method is a new simple practical approach adapted for current application circumstance, and it provides us a new idea for spatial data interoperability.},

  abstract = {Background: Considering the high prevalence of anxiety among adolescents and its horrible consequences, appropriate educational methods have to be used to prevent, control, and treat anxiety. Aim: To compare the effects of anxiety management training via microlearning and gamification on anxiety control among girl adolescents. Methods: In this randomized clinical trial with pre/posttest design, the research population included 13-15-year-old girl adolescents studying in the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades of high school in Shiraz in the academic year 2018-2019. The participants (n=378) were randomly selected from the schools and assigned to microlearning (n=125), gamification (n=129), and control (n=124) groups. After conducting the pretest using Spielberger's state/trait anxiety inventory, the educational intervention was carried out via microlearning and gamification for four weeks. The adolescents' anxiety levels were measured again immediately and two weeks after the intervention. Results: The results revealed no significant difference among the three groups regarding the mean scores of state anxiety (p=0.07) and trait anxiety (p=0.26) before the intervention. However, a significant difference was observed among the three groups concerning anxiety scores immediately and two weeks after the intervention (p\textexclamdown 0.001). This indicated the effectiveness of microlearning and gamification in reducing anxiety. Nonetheless, the two intervention methods were not significantly different in decreasing the level of anxiety (p\textquestiondown 0.05). Conclusion: The results demonstrated a decline in the microlearning and gamification groups' scores of state and trait anxiety after the intervention. Yet, anxiety reduced to a similar level in both intervention groups. Hence, the two methods were similarly effective in controlling the adolescents' anxiety. Therefore, both microlearning and gamification could be used to promote adolescents' mental health.},

  abstract = {Purpose Open data and data sharing should improve transparency of research. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how different institutional and individual factors affect the data sharing behavior of authors of research articles in sociology and political science. Design/methodology/approach Desktop research analyzed attributes of sociology and political science journals (n=262) from their websites. A second data set of articles (n=1,011; published 2012-2014) was derived from ten of the main journals (five from each discipline) and stated data sharing was examined. A survey of the authors used the Theory of Planned Behavior to examine motivations, behavioral control, and perceived norms for sharing data. Statistical tests (Spearman's , (2)) examined correlations and associations. Findings Although many journals have a data policy for their authors (78 percent in sociology, 44 percent in political science), only around half of the empirical articles stated that the data were available, and for only 37 percent of the articles could the data be accessed. Journals with higher impact factors, those with a stated data policy, and younger journals were more likely to offer data availability. Of the authors surveyed, 446 responded (44 percent). Statistical analysis indicated that authors' attitudes, reported past behavior, social norms, and perceived behavioral control affected their intentions to share data. Research limitations/implications Less than 50 percent of the authors contacted provided responses to the survey. Results indicate that data sharing would improve if journals had explicit data sharing policies but authors also need support from other institutions (their universities, funding councils, and professional associations) to improve data management skills and infrastructures. Originality/value This paper builds on previous similar research in sociology and political science and explains some of the barriers to data sharing in social sciences by combining journal policies, published articles, and authors' responses to a survey.},

  abstract = {Earth observation data sharing is an essential part of the data lifecycle and plays a critical role in Earth science research. Existing industry data sharing systems are affected by restrictions in distributed resource management and tightly coupled service interoperability. These systems currently offer no support for facilitating cross-disciplinary exploration and application. The lack of a national data sharing infrastructure has led to reduced international cooperation. These barriers are common and have hindered the development of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). The China GEOSS Data Sharing Network (China GEOSS DSNet) has been proposed as a part of China's Plan for Implementing GEOSS (2016-2025) to address the above issues. In this research, we designed a national GEOSS data sharing framework, including resource integration mechanism, sharing-oriented metadata standards, and lightweight interoperability service to coordinate various Earth observation resources. So far, more than 29 million archived satellite metadata records and 200 TB of high-quality satellite datasets have been integrated under this framework. The results were demonstrated in the following applications: domestic satellite archived metadata query service, international Earth observation resource sharing service, and disaster emergency response service.},

  abstract = {Medical errors are the eighth leading cause of mortality in the United States and contribute to over one million preventable injuries. In an effort to prevent medical errors, reporting systems serve as invaluable tools to detect patient safety events and quality problems longitudinally. Historically, trainees (i.e., students and residents) rarely submit incident reports for encountered patient safety threats. The authors propose an immersive learning experience utilizing gamification theory and leveraging the increasingly popular `escape room' to help resident trainees identify reportable patient safety priorities. All 130 incoming intern physicians at the Thomas Jefferson University (Jefferson) were enrolled in the Patient Safety Escape Room study as part of their residency orientation (June 2018). The residents were randomly divided into 16 teams. Each team was immersed in a simulated escape room, tasked with identifying a predetermined set of serious patient safety hazards, and successfully manually entering them into the Jefferson Event Reporting System within the time allotted to successfully `win the game' by `escaping the room'. Quick response (QR) codes were planted throughout the activity to provide in-game instructions; clues to solve the puzzle; and key information about patient safety priorities at Jefferson. All participants underwent a formal debriefing using the feedback capture grid method and completed a voluntary post-study survey, adapted from Brookfield's Critical Incident Questionnaire (CIQ). The study was IRB exempt. Thematic analysis of the post-activity CIQ survey (n = 102) revealed that interns were engaged during the immersive learning experience (n = 42) and were specifically engaged by having to independently identify patient safety threats (n = 30). Participants identified team role assignment (n = 52) and effective communication (n = 26) as the two most helpful actions needed to successfully complete the activity. Participants were overall surprised by the success of the education innovation (n = 45) and reported that it changed how they viewed patient safety threats. Areas for improvement include clearer game instructions and using a more streamlined event reporting process. The escape room patient-safety activity allowed interns to actively engage in an innovative orientation activity that highlighted the importance of patient safety hazards, as well as providing them with the opportunity to document event reports in real-time. Next steps will include longitudinally tracking the quantity of error reports entered by this cohort to determine the effectiveness of this educational intervention.},

After screening, 55 articles were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. The analysis pointed at 19 barriers to IDS in four themes: External environmental barriers, interagency partnership barriers, organizational readiness barriers, and individual motivation barriers. The conceptualization of the research findings revealed five trans-barrier conceptual dimensions (political and structural, territorial, leadership, financial, and IT), from which further, more in-depth investigations should be performed. Also, the conceptualization indicated that territoriality is possibly the main barrier to China's IDS development. Territoriality offers a novel prospective for studying IDS. This research presents a robust theoretical basis for future study. Also, it provides an overview on IDS development in China and offers useful insights for similar efforts in different countries.},

With the recent open-science movement, there has been a call for free access to data, tools and methods in academia. In recent years, subject-based and institutional repositories and data centres have emerged along with online publishing. Many scientific records, including published articles and data, have been made available via new platforms. In the United Kingdom, most major research funders had a data policy and require researchers to include a `data-sharing plan' when applying for funding. However, there are a number of barriers to the full-scale adoption of data sharing. Those barriers are not only technical, but also psychological and social. A survey was conducted with over 1800 UK-based academics to explore the extent of support of data sharing and the characteristics and factors associated with data-sharing practice. It found that while most academics recognised the importance of sharing research data, most of them had never shared or reused research data. There were differences in the extent of data sharing between different gender, academic disciplines, age and seniority. It also found that the awareness of Research Council UK's (RCUK) Open-Access (OA) policy, experience of Gold and Green OA publishing, attitudes towards the importance of data sharing and experience of using secondary data were associated with the practice of data sharing. A small group of researchers used social media such as Twitter, blogs and Facebook to promote the research data they had shared online. Our findings contribute to the knowledge and understanding of open science and offer recommendations to academic institutions, journals and funding agencies.},

The open science movement is reshaping scientific culture and addressing the challenges of transparency and reproducibility of research. To advance open science in neuroimaging the Organization for Human Brain Mapping created the Committee on Best Practice in Data Analysis and Sharing (COBIDAS), charged with creating a report that collects best practice recommendations from experts and the entire brain imaging community. The purpose of this work is to elaborate the principles of open and reproducible research for neuroimaging using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and then distill these principles to specific research practices. Many elements of a study are so varied that practice cannot be prescribed, but for these areas we detail the information that must be reported to fully understand and potentially replicate a study. For other elements of a study, like statistical modelling where specific poor practices can be identified, and the emerging areas of data sharing and reproducibility, we detail both good practice and reporting standards. For each of seven areas of a study we provide tabular listing of over 100 items to help plan, execute, report and share research in the most transparent fashion. Whether for individual scientists, or for editors and reviewers, we hope these guidelines serve as a benchmark, to raise the standards of practice and reporting in neuroimaging using MRI.},

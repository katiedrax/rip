This dataset contains 7 files:
     4 of these files comprise the basic reproducible cards and literature for use in a standard game of R.I.P.
     3 of these files contain background information on the construction and method behind building this game.

The 4 gameplay files are all PDF format:
     * RIP_game_cards_answers_v1.0 - the current full set of answer cards. These cards can be printed on white card/paper single sided, and will down cut into nine cards per sheet.
     * RIP_game_cards_questions_v1.0 - the current full set of question cards. These cards can be printed on white card/paper, and should be printed double-sided to reproduce the all-black front-and-back appearance of the question cards. They will cut down into nine cards per sheet.
     * RIP_game_how_to_play - a set of basic (and even more basic) instructions on how to play the game of R.I.P.
     * RIP_game_terms_of_use - a set of terms of use, including licensing information for the concept and code underlying the game

The 3 background files are:
     * RIP_game_underlying_card_texts_v1.0 - a document containing all question and answer texts, separated by paragraphs for ease of use with the Bigger, Blacker Cards code. These question and answer texts can be directly copied and pasted into the BiggerBlackerCards online card generator to reproduce the current card set. This document also contains calculations for producing the correct ratio of questions:answer cards, and suggested ratio of professional:comic answer cards. This file is a Rich Text Format file .rtf
     * RIP_game_question_answer_matrix - a spreadsheet containing non-exclusive "correct" answers to the current question set. This matrix is non-exclusive as there are many slight variants of correct answers within the answers. This file is a comma separated values file .CSV
     * RIP_game_feedback_form_link - a document containing a link to a feedback form designed to enable the game designers to improve or develop the game further. This file is a PDF.
